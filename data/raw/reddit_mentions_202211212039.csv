&gt; Russia&amp;#039;s Wagner Group - the once-secretive private militia controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin - has opened a military technology centre in St Petersburg, in the latest move by the Putin ally who has criticised the Kremlin&amp;#039;s defence top brass over the Ukraine conflict.

&gt; The opening of the &amp;quot;Wagner Centre&amp;quot; on Friday is seen as another step by Prigozhin to publicise his military credentials and take a more public role in shaping Russia&amp;#039;s defence policy.

&gt; It follows several steps to bolster his public profile in recent weeks, in contrast to years the businessman spent operating in the shadows and denying he was behind Wagner, whose contract soldiers are supporting Russia&amp;#039;s army in Ukraine.

&gt; Prigozhin has made a series of outspoken interventions about Russia&amp;#039;s setbacks during what it calls the special military operation in Ukraine, joining Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov in ridiculing the performance of Russia&amp;#039;s generals.

&gt; Wagner was established in 2014 to support pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, but after years shrouded in secrecy it has taken an increasingly public role in Russia&amp;#039;s foreign policy and the invasion of Ukraine.

&gt; Wagner has been accused of committing human rights abuses in Ukraine, Syria, Libya, Central African Republic, Sudan and Mozambique.

 - Western officials say commanders ’leaving demoralised and leaderless men to face Ukrainian assaults’

Russian commanders in Kherson are likely fleeing and leaving ill-equipped and “demoralised” troops to face Ukrainian assaults, Western officials have said.

Officials said that while more of Vladimir Putin’s troops were arriving in an apparent attempt to shore up their defensive positions in the key city, many were recently mobilised reservists who were often “woefully equipped and prepared”.

“In Kherson, it is likely that most echelons of command have now withdrawn across the river leaving demoralised and leaderless men to face Ukrainian assaults. At least some reservists are arriving in theatre without weapons,” one official said.

They added that the Russians were also running “critically short” of munitions – including artillery shells with additional supplies even being sought from North Korea.

“Without the guns and rocket launchers being fired everything else is grinding to a halt,” one official said.

The officials suggested Mr Putin is likely to come under increasing pressure from nationalist hardliners as he prepares to withdraw Russian forces from Kherson.

The officials suggested Mr Putin is likely to come under increasing pressure from nationalist hardliners as he prepares to withdraw Russian forces from Kherson.

Officials said planning to pull forces out of Kherson on the Dnipro River appeared to be well-advanced with a large proportion of the civilian population having already been moved out to the city.

But while officials expect it to be presented by the Kremlin as a humanitarian evacuation rather than a military retreat, they believe it will not prevent further criticism of the conduct of the war.

The assessment comes as one former Putin ally – the head of the notorious mercenaries the Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin – stepped up his criticism of the Russian leader.

In a statement earlier this week he pointedly praised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – who is routinely denounced by Moscow as a neo-Nazi drug addict – as a “strong and confident leader”.

&gt; Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly approved the evacuation of civilians from parts of Russian-occupied Kherson in southern Ukraine.

&gt; Mr Putin&amp;#039;s comments followed reports on Thursday that Russian soldiers, too, had been leaving Kherson - in what would mark a major withdrawal.

&gt; Civilians were first urged to leave Kherson in the middle of last month, as the Russian army switched the city to defensive mode.

&gt; Russia claims the Kherson region and three other Ukrainian regions as its own territory, though it does not fully control any of them.

&gt; Of these, Mr Putin said 49,000 were already involved in active fighting - a figure not independently verified by the BBC. Meanwhile, a Russian private military company, the Wagner Group, has opened its first official headquarters, in St Petersburg.

&gt; Mr Putin has now amended the Russian law on calling up reservists to include men convicted of serious crimes who recently left prison.

&gt; As of early November, more than 500 Russian prisoners have died in the war in Ukraine.

&gt; In total, at least 458 prisoners hired by Yevgeny Prigozhin died in Ukraine by mid-October.

&gt; This means that by October, the Armed Forces of Ukraine had killed approximately a quarter of the Russian prisoners who reached the front.

&gt; At the same time, according to the Center, the total number of mercenaries of the Wagner Group, including prisoners and ordinary mercenaries, who died in Ukraine is from 800 to 1,000 people.

&gt; Some relatives of those killed confirmed to The Insider that they were indeed serving sentences in colonies when they were recruited into the PMC and recently died in Ukraine.

&gt; Later, information emerged that almost all convicts from two penal colonies, who had been recruited by Wagner PMC to fight in Ukraine, were killed.

From what I understand, Konni is essentially Russia's in universe equivalent of Shadow Company, probably based off the real life Wagner group. 

Makarov and The Inner Circle hired Mercenaries in the original MW trilogy, but they never specified what PMC they hired them from or if they were independent. I wonder if Konni is meant to fill in the gap as to who.

Having failed to gain early air superiority in the conflict, the Air Force has continued to play a supporting role in Moscow’s invasion, a failure some analysts say is central to the faltering performance of Russian forces in Ukraine as a whole. 

""The Russian Air Force is being used episodically, mostly to support the Armed Forces on the frontline,"" said Leonid Nersisyan, a defense analyst and research fellow at the Armenian Research &amp; Development Institute. 

After billions of rubles were invested in modernizing Russia’s Air Force over the past decade, many analysts predicted that Russian air power would quickly overwhelm Ukraine’s defenses, gaining free reign in the skies over Kyiv. 

But heavy losses in early March pushed the Air Force to adopt more risk-averse tactics, playing a subordinate role to Russia’s ground troops, a move analysts have attributed to the inexperience of pilots in Russia's recently modernized fleet as well as the differing Russian approach to the use of air power in combat.

""After suffering heavy losses in the first 10 days of March, Russia was forced to revise its approach and has remained risk averse in Ukraine,"" said Guy Plopsky, an independent Israeli defense analyst focusing on the Russian military. 

Unlike a NATO-trained air force, which would quickly look to establish its dominance in a war by flying complex sorties to root out enemy air defenses, gather intelligence and eliminate enemy air infrastructure, Russia’s Air Force has mainly been used in Ukraine as an extension of frontline power.

This has meant taking off from airbases in southern Russia and Belarus to fly rapid-bombing sorties over Ukrainian territory at low altitudes. 

""The fixed-wing aircraft Russia is primarily using to conduct strikes are the Su-25 ground attack, and Su-34 strike fighter,"" said Plopsky. 

""The Su-25s take off in pairs or sometimes in groups of four, ingress to a target area at low altitude, maybe 50 meters or less, and then lob the rockets and bank left or right and return back to base,"" he added. 

Footage shared last month by Fighterbomber, a pro-Kremlin military blogger, displayed exactly these tactics in use, as two Russian Su-25s flying at low altitudes to avoid enemy air defenses dropped bombs on a target while narrowly evading a Ukrainian surface-to-air missile. 

Such attacks have been unrelenting throughout the war. 

According to recent figures cited by General Sergei Surovikin, the new head of Russian operations in Ukraine, Russia has flown a total of 34,000 combat sorties in Ukraine since Feb. 24, or roughly 150 per day. 

Those sorties have almost exclusively been launched from air bases in southern Russia and Belarus, including the Morozovsk, Millerovo and Taganrog air bases in the Rostov region, Baltimor air base in the southern Russian region of Voronezh, as well as the Saki air base on the annexed Crimean peninsula. 

But while these tactics have allowed Russia to limit its losses in Ukraine, analysts estimate that they have also impacted the level of air support its jets can offer. Without the intricate multi-aircraft sorties required for intelligence gathering, Russian pilots are often reliant on ground troops to provide them with target coordinates.

""We send them the coordinates where Nazis are located and we are very pleased when [those places] are shelled,"" said one post on Reverse Side of the Medal, a pro-war Telegram channel with alleged links to the Wagner mercenary group. 

Dubious intelligence and the use of unguided munitions means strikes by jets are often ineffective, Plopsky said.

""Far from all of the targets Russian jets have struck are of military value. Civilian targets are also known to be deliberately attacked, though in some cases a pilot might not even be told what exactly he's bombing,"" he added.

The Russian Air Force has become the subject of much scrutiny since the war in Ukraine began, despite Moscow investing vast sums of money to build one of the world's largest air forces.

Our war correspondent Maddog088 covering the conflict of Virolathi was killed along with his partner RAC in a gruesome and unprovoked attack by the Rebel fighters.  He recorded the incident before his death and can be found in the link below. *Video contains violent and disturbing images and may not be appropriate for childrens.*

It's been several weeks since the conflict broke out between the rebel forces and the government backed CDF. Since last week the CDF lost critical and strategical positions such as the North East Airfiled and the North Military base.  *^(More below)*

[Week 5 map progress](https://preview.redd.it/s8bprfzl5yx91.jpg?width=1008&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=322d4e30e3adb61420a9acc7384cdfd458fd1a2d)

The Rebel forces appears to be relentless and nothing seems to be capable of stopping or slowing them down. In contrast the CDF are unprepared and seems unable to consolidate forces in order to assault and eliminate the threats. In addition the CDF allies (the AFRF ) seems to have disappeared from the conflict with the exception of the Wagner group still operating in limited capacity.   


We also received several reports of war crime being committed by the rebel fighters, ranging from executing prisoners of war, using child labour and child soldiers and shooting ejected pilots as found in this video  


[https://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/yjsnib/something\_about\_war\_crimes\_that\_is\_satisfying/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/yjsnib/something_about_war_crimes_that_is_satisfying/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)   


The conflict continues and we have no idea how or even if the CDF can defeat these barbaric rebels. It seems like the only hope is an intervention from the AFRF.

&gt; Prisoners recruited to a notorious Russian paramilitary are being tortured and executed by their commanders, according to a Russian anti-torture NGO. Convicts serving in the Wagner Group had fingers cut off for offences such as using their phones and arguing with superiors, reported the Gulagu.net project, citing correspondence with prisoners at the frontline.

&gt; Paramilitary officers have executed prisoners in their units, the NGO alleged.

&gt; The group estimates that around 100 prisoners serving in Wagner units have been executed to date, and claims that bodies are routinely burned to hide the evidence of torture.

&gt; President Putin changed course during the war in Ukraine and awarded military honours to senior Wagner commanders.

&gt; Around 20,000 prisoners have now been pressed into service, according to Moscow-based prisoner rights group, Russia Behind Bars, with recruitment ongoing.

&gt; They have been deployed to some of the most dangerous parts of the front and suffered high rates of attrition, according to the NGO. Wagner commanders are using prisoners for &amp;quot;Suicide attacks&amp;quot; in grinding offensives around Donetsk, according to Russian military analyst, Ian Matveev.

Afghanistan-

The late afternoon sun beat down upon the parched, rocky, orange colored mountains north of Kandahar Air Field as five bearded, heavily burdened and heavily armed men moved silently but swiftly up the ragged, rock strewn path as they stalked something as deadly and as formidable as they were. Over the past two weeks in Kandahar Province, a number of service members had been hit by sniper fire including four US Marines, three Canadian infantrymen, a US Army medic, and seven Afghan National Army tactical team operatives. Even a giant C-130 Hercules transport took two rounds in the number one engine as it tried to land at Kandahar Air Field. The shots ranged from 800 meters to as far as 1,200 meters. The enemy sniper was good, and he had a set of steel balls. It was also more than likely that the sniper wasn’t a typical Taliban insurgent. This guy was a professional.

“Whatcha’ got, Cory?” whispered Lieutenant Jake Wolfe, the SEAL Team’s lean, tanned, squad leader into his earpiece.

Fifty meters up the rocky ledge, Chief Petty Officer Cory Pretty slowly peered around a stone boulder which obstructed the path. The basalt grey boulder was square shaped, roughly three feet wide and five feet tall and butted up tightly beside the face of the ledge.

“It’s a cave or a tunnel,” whispered the Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer with the thick, dirty blonde beard, as he leaned back behind the boulder, careful to not dislodge any rocks or pebbles which would give away his position. “About thirty meters off the trail. The entrance has been carefully built up with rocks and stones so that there’s only a two foot wide opening. Too small to be observed by air, but big enough for a sniper to shoot down into the air field unnoticed. Also, I think that this boulder has been rolled here on purpose to block the path.”

“Roger,” whispered Lt. Wolfe. “Can climb up and around the boulder to get to the cave entrance?”

“No,” answered Chief Pretty. “Not without exposing ourselves.

Lt. Wolfe figured as much. He looked up at the sheer orange rock wall which his team was pressed against. There was no way to scale to the top. They were stretched out and exposed with next to no cover. A very unenviable position. Still, they had a mission to accomplish and if the sniper had spotters out in the surrounding ridges, they’d be caught out in the open while the sniper escaped. The SEALs had to act fast.

“Keep eyes on the target, Cory. We’re moving up.”

Once together behind the boulder, Lt. Wolfe scanned the target objective. Just as Chief Pretty described, there was only one way to get to the tunnel entrance and that was right up the middle. The boulder blocked all but two feet of the narrow trail, so the assaulting SEALs needed to also be careful not to trip and fall the sixty or so feet straight down the rock face of the cliff to the ledge below. 

Then, turning behind him, Lt. Wolfe signaled, “Darren. Paul. Up.”

Petty Officer First Class Darren Hilliard, the team’s lean and muscular black Mark 48 (MK 48) machine gunner, scrambled silently up the ridge to the lieutenant’s side followed by Petty Officer First Class Paul Gimsby, the teams body building sniper carrying his Mark 13 (MK 13) sniper rifle.

“Okay, Listen up,” started Lt. Wolfe. “We can’t wait for dark and we’re too exposed here. And we can’t flank the cave so we have to go right up the middle. 

“Sir,” said big Petty Officer Gimsby. “Do we know that the sniper is in there? I mean, we go in making a bunch of noise and he’s not there, he’ll know we got teams looking out for him and just dig deeper.”

“We don’t know he’s in there,” admitted Wolfe. “And from the targets he’s already hit, there may be a half dozen of his firing points scattered around the ridgeline. It’s a calculated risk, but I have a feeling…”

All of a sudden, a loud hollow thump sounded from around the corner of the boulder coming from the direction of the cave and all of the SEALs froze. Very slowly, Chief Pretty peered around the boulder and spied a thin wisp of dust and smoke drift from the small opening of the cave.

“He’s here,” Chief Pretty whispered, knowing that somewhere a kilometer away down in Kandahar Valley, another allied soldier just got hit. Almost immediately, a second hollow thump like a base drum echoed from around the corner.

Wolfe quickly instructed his men on how he wanted to assault the cave entrance. Lieutenant Wolfe gave himself a few seconds before the attack to slowly lift Petty Officer Second Class Terrell ‘Terry’ Nguyen, the team’s Vietnamese medic, up on top of the relatively flat boulder to provide security for the assault. Almost immediately, one hundred meters ahead on an elevated spot further up the ridge, Nguyen suddenly spotted a camouflaged figure looking down into the Kandahar Air Base. The man was operating an enhanced optics targeting scope and talking into an earpiece. Nguyen brought up his rifle just as the figure noticed him. The figure, obviously an enemy spotter who was calling down targets for the sniper, brought up his modern Russian made AK-12 assault rifle but was cut down by a well-placed shot to the head from Nguyen’s MK 17 SCAR (scar) assault rifle.

Not seeing what Nguyen had just shot at but knowing that they’d just lost the element of surprise, Lieutenant Wolfe none the less gave the order to, “Move!”

Chief Cory immediately whipped around the boulder, stepping away to allow his fellow SEALs to move around behind him as he fired a high explosive 40mm grenade from the M-203 launcher mounted under the barrel of his M-4 rifle before quickly ducking behind the cover of the boulder again. The ear shattering blast blew apart the rock façade, causing the shrapnel to fly in all directions. Instantaneously and before the dust and smoke even cleared, Petty Officer Hilliard rushed past Chief Pretty and raced towards the entrance firing his machine gun into the smoking maw of the cave with big Paul Gimsby and Chief Pretty close behind. 

Hilliard stopped at the mouth of the cave and fired another burst inside before raising his weapon. Immediately, Gimsby was inside the cave, sniper rifle up. However, going from direct sunlight into a dark cave required a second for Gimsby’s eyes to adjust, a second in which gave the enemy sniper, who had been taking cover behind a fighting position inside the cave, a chance to fire.

Shouting a warning, Chief Pretty both grabbed and pushed Gimsby into the side of the cave, the enemy sniper’s round bouncing off the wall less than two feet from the back of Chief Pretty’s head. Gimsby raised his sniper rifle just as the enemy sniper readjusted his aim and both snipers fired at nearly the same time from less than twenty feet apart. 

“Are you okay, Gimsby?” said Lieutenant Wolfe as he looked down at the big Navy SEAL sniper cradling the ruins his beloved MK 13 sniper rifle. Gimsby’s left hand was red and swollen, his thumb bent back in an unnatural position. The enemy sniper’s round impacted the MK 13, knocking it out of Gimsby’s hands. Fortunately, Gimsby fired a split second before the enemy sniper did, and Gimsby didn’t miss.

“I’m fine, sir,” replied Gimsby, not looking up.

“Terry,” said Lt. Wolfe. “Come check on Gimsby.”

“Moving, sir,” replied Petty Officer Nguyen, unstrapping his aid bag from his back.

“What do we have, Chief?” said Wolfe after he saw Nguyen treating Gimsby’s swollen left hand and wrist.

“This is going to hurt a bit,” he heard Nguyen say.

“No it ain’t,” replied Gimsby. “Do what you gotta’ do, Terry.”

The adrenaline pumping through Gimby’s veins after his near death experience was better than any pain killer that Nguyen could provide. 

Chief pretty looked down at the Caucasian enemy sniper with the bullet hole between his eyes. “Well, sir,” answered Chief Pretty. “He sure as hell isn’t a local.”

The enemy sniper wore a digital camouflage pattern uniform of varying shades of brown and a modular combat vest similar to the ones that the US Marines wore.

“Russian Spetz?” asked Hilliard.

“Maybe,” said Chief Pretty. “But I’d wager that he’s part of the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary outfit that works with the Russian regular army but is better trained and equipped. Putin uses them everywhere that regular Russian military forces can’t go. Africa. Eastern Europe. The Middle East. South America. Portland. Seattle. Minneapolis. Everywhere Putin needs to stir up trouble.”

“Interesting,” said Lieutenant Wolfe as he turned to exit the cave. “I’m going outside to call this one in. See if the intel guys are tracking this. I don’t like Russians playing in my sand box.”

“Roger that, sir,” said Chief Pretty, leaning down to pick up the dead enemy’s sniper rifle, before walking over to Gimsby and Nguyen. 

“How’s he looking, Terry?” 

“Patching Gimsby up is getting to be a hobby on this deployment, Chief,” answered Nguyen. “Had to pop his dislocated thumb back into place and his wrist is fractured, but he’ll live.”

“Gimsby?” said Chief Pretty.

“It’s like Terry said, Chief,” replied Gimsby, waving his heavily bandaged and wrapped left hand. “I’m fine. Nothing that a dirty magazine, a bottle of lotion, and four minutes of privacy in the shitter won’t cure.”

“I don’t know about that,” chuckled Chief Pretty. “But how about this?” Chief Pretty handed over the enemy’s sniper rifle to the big Navy SEAL. 

Grabbing it with his right hand, Gimsby looked it over. “Dragunov,” he grunted. “Not as nice as my MK 13, but its rugged enough. It’ll do until we get back.”

“Heads up,” announced Lieutenant Wolfe as he reentered the cave. “We got two WIA down in the valley from the sniper we just killed. We got Nine Line medevac in the air so our extraction won’t be for another hour. In the meantime, Six Actual wants us to check out this cave system to see if it connects to other sniper firing positions or to see if there’s any usable intel we can find.”

“This cave is pretty deep, sir,” said Hilliard. “I’ve gone in about fifty meters but it looks like it extends much farther than that. Maybe a hundred or even more. Gets almost pitch black the further you go.”

“Okay,” said Lt. Wolfe striding deeper into the cave. “Let’s move.”

Lieutenant Wolfe ran into the outstretched open palm of Chief Pretty. “Easy, there, El-Tee. You aren’t a grunt anymore, not since you pinned them bars on.” Chief Pretty stared firmly into Lieutenant Wolfe’s eyes. “I’ll take point. We already lost one squad leader. I don’t want to lose another one.”

Lieutenant Wolfe paused, painfully remembering that he gained command of Second Platoon after the death of the platoon’s former leader, his mentor and close friend, Lieutenant Rick Guzman.

“No Gooses, right Cory?” said Lieutenant Wolfe.

“That’s right, sir,” answered Chief Pretty. “Like Lieutenant Guzman used to say. No Gooses.”

The team walked deeper into the cave where, seventy meters in, they found a cache of twelve 9K333 Verba MANPADS (man-pads) launchers, the most advanced Russian version of America’s Stinger portable surface to air missile launchers. The presence of these weapons in the hands of skilled Russian mercenaries would have caused havoc so close to the Kandahar Air Field.

Beyond where they found the cache, the cave dipped into absolute pitch darkness. Lieutenant Wolf reported the disturbing find back to Kandahar and was ordered to secure the cache of surface to air missiles and probe deeper into the cave. A support company of Army cavalry troopers and EOD specialists were being dispatched to the SEAL’s location. They were expected to be on station in about an hour.

“Gimsby, I need you and Terry to secure these SAMs,” said Lieutenant Wolfe. “I want you to cover our six and secure the entrance while we go further into the cave. Everyone else, break out your NODs (“nods”-night vision optical devises). It’s going to be midnight from here on in.”

“Sir,” protested Gimsby. “I got this. There isn’t any need to keep two people guarding the exit.”

“Sir,” said Hilliard. “I can more than secure the cache and cover the exit with the MK 48. In close quarters combat,…”

Hilliard trailed off and Lieutenant Wolfe instinctively knew what Hilliard was trying to say. Hilliard’s MK 48 machine gun wasn’t the best weapon system to utilize in the close confines of a cave, but it was optimal to secure the team’s vulnerable six o’clock position. Plus, Gimsby had just gone through a near life ending event, an event which would have sent far lesser men running, cowering, and hiding after such a traumatic event. Petty Officer Gimsby instead sought to continue the mission and move forward, ever forward. Denying him that would have been tantamount to cutting off his balls and putting him in a ballerina outfit.

“You got slack, Hilliard,” said Wolfe. “Everyone else, stay sharp.”

Lieutenant Wolfe looked into the near opaque blackness of the cave as he strapped on his own NODs. “Terry, you have trail. I want you to drop a chem-light every twenty-five meters so that we have a path back to the entrance.”

“Too easy, sir,” replied Nguyen.

“Okay. Let’s move.”

Hilliard took up a prone firing position a few meters in front of the crates of Russian missiles, setting up his machine gun pointing back towards the entrance as the rest of his team mates filed past him and headed deeper into the cave, the crunch of their boots fading the further they went. They had been gone for several minutes when Hilliard heard Chief Cory call the team to a sudden halt in his ear piece. 

“Hold up. Shit! Is that what I think it is?” whispered Chief Cory  
   
 

“Is that a woman and a… a kitten?” Hilliard heard Terry exclaim through his ear piece.

Hilliard looked behind him where his team had gone but saw only dust swirling in the inky blackness.

“Stop! Don’t move!” said Lieutenant Wolfe in the Pashtun dialect. “We’re Navy SEALs. We mean you no harm. Who are you? What are you doing here?”

Suddenly, over his ear piece, Hilliard heard a leering, almost mocking voice exclaim in a Brooklyn accent, “Howdy, fellas. My name is Hellfire! Pleased ta’ meet cha’!”

There was a sudden squelching noise so loud that Hilliard had to quickly take out his ear piece and toss it away. Then, picking it back up and putting it again to his ear, Hilliard was alarmed to find that the communication device was completely silent. 

“Lieutenant Wolfe,” said Hilliard. “Chief? Come in!” Silence.

“Paul? Terry? Can you hear me?”

After a second, Hilliard muttered, “Shit,” before snatching up his machine gun and tearing down the cave in the direction the rest of the team had gone. Soon engulfed in almost total darkness, Hilliard’s NODs easily picked up the chem-lights which Nguyen had dropped on the rock strewn ground. He passed one then another then, after the cave narrowed and turned slightly left, Hilliard passed a third dropped chem-light. However, at the fourth chem-light, Hilliard stopped abruptly. 

“Shit!” exclaimed Hilliard. In front of him was a solid wall of granite. On the ground, one of Nguyen’s chem-lights protruded half way out of the rock wall.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/ykemv0/dungeons_and_dragunovs_pt_2/,,DUNGEONS,0

V.

Thanks to the map, the SEALs were able to navigate down through the multiple levels of the dungeon, ignoring the treasures, avoiding the traps and pitfalls, and fighting only when absolutely necessary. At the base of this last stairwell, Nguyen said, “This is it. This is the last level. From here, the map just ends.”

The stairwell opened up into the largest chamber of them all, a dimly lit underground cavern that spanned a mile long from one end of the cavern to the other end and was a quarter mile wide. Running down the middle of the cavern was a vast black chasm three hundred feet wide which descended down, down, down into the fathomless pits. A howling wind belched up from the chasm, bringing with it the smell of Sulphur and rot. A narrow hanging stone bridge, barely three feet wide, spanned the width of the ominous pit to hell in front of them.

“So, this is it?” said Chief Pretty.

“Looks like it, Chief,” said Lieutenant Wolfe. “The map doesn’t say anything else except here at the very bottom where it says: “Copyright- Made in Doctor Creepen’s Vault.”

“Looks like the only way across is over that bridge.”

“I’ll take point, El-Tee,” said Nguyen.

“I got it, Terry,” said Gimsby.

“I’ve got point,” said Lieutenant Wolfe.

“Sir…” protested Chief Pretty.

“I said, I got point, Cory!” insisted Wolfe.

“FOOLS! The only point you will be getting is the one at the end of my great bastard sword!”

Unnoticed by the SEALs before, a great hulking figure strode out of the dim light clad in archaic heavy black armor adorned with spikes and the skulls of those it had vanquished in battle. Its helmet was massive and mounted two black elk antlers. Glowing red eyes beamed angrily from the black eye slits of its helmet and in its heavily gauntleted left hand he carried a great bastard sword which was a foot wide and as long as the dreadful figure stood tall. 

“I am a Chaos Orc Anarchist Terror, or Coastie!

“I am Coastie the Guard, and I guard the ancient Bridge of More-Doom which spans the bottomless scar! Like all Coasties, I represent the greatest of all warriors and the mightiest of all military branches which serve the forces of darkness in the Realm. Kneel, United States Navy SEALs! Your pathetic breed pales in comparison to the might of the Coasties! Your quest ends here! Kneel in recognition of the superiority of Coastie the Guard and I will grant you a quick…”

THOOM!

The mighty chaos knight fell backwards from a sniper round through his great horned helmet, arms and legs encased in black armor splayed out, weapon flying into the black pit as his back hit the ground. 

“Coastie talks too much,” said Gimsby without the slightest hint of regret that he fired his second to last round and was now down to only one bullet left in his Dragunov. As the team walked towards the Bridge of More-Doom, they said nothing as Gimsby pulled out his Glock 19 and shot the fallen chaos knight three more times in the head.

Back in the Dungeon Master’s throne room, Hellfire turned from the Mirror of Seeing and glanced towards another mirror mounted on the opposite wall, the mirror which allows communication to the internet in the realm which the Navy SEALs had come.

Relighting his cigar, the kitten stared into the mirror and said, “Okay now. I know you can hear me. I don’t want to see any of you noobs blowing up the comments section whining about, ‘…but the Coasties aren’t part of the military…’, or ‘…the Coasties do a very important job guarding coasts…” or some other crap like that. It’s just a story. Oh, and I also don’t want to hear a bunch of whining about breaking the fourth wall. I don’t see you bitching when Ryan Reynolds does it. Anyway, back to the show. You’re gonna’ love this next part, baby!”

“Does anyone see an opening or a passageway on the other side?” said Wolfe.

“No,” said Chief Pretty.

“Nothing,” added Nguyen.

“Alright,” said Wolfe, pulling off his pack and grabbing a coil of climbing rope, tying one end to a heavy duty, rock climbing grade carabiner on his modular vest. Then, tossing the rest of the rope back, he ordered his SEALs, “Connect to the rope and stay within arm’s reach!”

He then pulled several chem-lights from his pack. Breaking one, the tube produced a bright, florescent red glow. Wolfe unstrapped his knife and cut the top off the tube, flicking his wrist in order to splash a line of the glowing fluid on the black bridge. A thin glowing red line marked an illuminated path about twelve feet along the narrow bridge. Satisfied that there were no pitfalls or traps along the illuminated trail, Wolfe stuffed his cargo pockets with the rest of the chem-lights and prepared to lead his SEALs across the final obstacle of the Dungeon of More-Doom.

“Hey! Look out!”

Lieutenant Wolfe turned in time to see all three of his SEALs snatched up by long, sickly brown-green tentacles which emerged from the pit and suspended in the air. Before he could bring his rifle to bear, a warm, slimy tentacle wrapped around his torso and yanked him off his feet, lifting him up unto the air. A monstrously huge bulbous head slowly rose from the pit, resembling that of an octopus with dozens of tentacles writhing in what would be the mouth. The head was easily fifty feet tall and seemed to meld into an equally bulbous human shaped body whose shoulders measured at least one hundred fifty feet wide. Emerging from its back stretched two mottled green bat-like wings if, when outstretched, would have exceeded four hundred feet from clawed tip to clawed tip. The entirety of the hellish thing was covered in inky brown slime whose stench made the SEALs gag and wretch. The entity brought up the tentacles which had snared the four Navy SEALs up to its hideous face, giant yellow eyes glaring at them from under the black shadows of its overhanging brow. There was no mistaking it. This was not a mere legend created from the mind of HP Lovecraft. The thing was real. Cthulhu was real, and at this moment, Lieutenant Jake Wolfe and the rest of his men knew that there was no shooting their way out of this one.

Behind the SEALs in the passage which they had emerged, a small, white, furry thing jumped into the cavern. More swiftly than the eye could perceive, the small feline leapt from the edge of the chasm up, up, and up upon Cthulhu’s great forehead.

Hellfire suddenly began to grow, transforming from a tiny white kitten into a frightful eight foot tall muscular black werecat creature with two foot long horns protruding from his skull and six inch long, razor sharp claws protruding from human looking hands. The monstrosity that was once the kitten Hellfire began rapidly slashing and gouging on the top of Cthulhu’s massive green, octopus shaped head. 

“Let em’ go!” roared Hellfire as great, gooey, chunks of the elder god’s forehead went flying under the werecat’s relentless stabbing and slashing assault. “C’mon! C’mon! C’mon! Let em’ go! Put em’ down on the other side of the ledge! Gently!”

Cthulhu let out a bellowing noise which shook the entire cavern, a noise which sounded much like a whimpering moan. His wildly flailing tentacles settled down as the four tentacles which held the Navy SEALs tightly in its slimy grip eased over to the other side of the crevasse ledge.

“Atta’ boy, ya’ big lug!” growled Hellfire, as he posed like a super hero on the brow of mighty Cthulhu’s head. “Gently! Gently! Put em’ down gently!”

The elder god dropped the SEALs safely on the other side of the ledge with a soft thump. Hellfire jumped down from Cthulhu’s forehead, landing next to the SEALs in his diminutive form of a small white kitten with red tipped ears. Lighting a cigar, Hellfire growled up at Cthulhu. “Okay, you big baby! Get outta’ here! Scram! Beat it! Quit screwing around!”

The great green leviathan looked mournfully down at the kitten, his many tentacles wiggling like a puppy’s tail begging for attention.

“Ahhh, you big baby! You aren’t in trouble. Just scram, for now. We can play bobbing for hipsters later!”

Cthulhu yipped happily before slowly descending back down into the inky depths of the bottomless crevasse, the ancient elder god eager for play time later with his best friend.

“That did not just fucking happen!” exclaimed Gimsby, picking himself up from the ground and checking to see if his Dragunov had been damaged. Curiously, Hellfire was watching Gimsby closely, and seeing that the rugged sniper rifle was still fully functional, Hellfire said, “He’s not that bad. In fact, for an elder god, Cthulhu is really just a toddler. To tell you the truth, his real name is Cutie Tooth, but he still can’t pronounce the words.”

“Why did you help us, cat?” said Lieutenant Wolfe, wiping the smelly slime from his weapon and vest. “What is your stake in this whole deal?”

“What?” said Hellfire innocently. “Is that the thanks I get for bringing you to the end of this quest?”

A glowing, fiery round portal opened in the face of the rock wall, the fragrant breeze of fresh air issuing from the other side. 

“C’mon, fella’s. Let’s get the hell out of here.”

“Not yet, cat,” said Lieutenant Wolfe. “We still have some questions.”

“You need us, cat,” said Chief Pretty. “If you didn’t, you wouldn’t have rescued us from your little pet. We know it was you who had the power to teleport us back at the very beginning. But you didn’t. You needed us to enter this dungeon. What are you getting out of all this?”

Hellfire’s shoulders slumped as his smile faded. “Okay, okay, okay. If you really need to know the truth. I helped you guys because I felt like I owe you.”

“What?” said Nguyen. “What are you talking about?”

Hellfire signed. “Look, a while ago I visited your realm and met a girl named Annie. Sweet little girl, a real angel. She loved me, despite some pretty nasty tricks that I pulled on her. That little shit grew on me. I guess that snot nosed brat inspired me to want to be something greater than just a mean-spirited demonic little shit.”

The kitten laughed a sad laugh and actually wiped a tear from his eyes. 

“I wasn’t too thrilled about her mom, though, and her mom’s boyfriend was a real piece of shit, believe me. But Annie’s dad… her real dad, he must have been something special. He was a Navy SEAL, just like you guys, and he taught her how to be kind, brave, and strong. That helped Annie survive some terrible abuse until I took care of the problem.”

“What happened to her dad?” asked Gimsby.

“He was killed in Bananastan… er, I mean Afghanistan. Anne called that hell hole Bananastan…”

“Did you get the SEAL’s name?” said Chief Pretty, still suspicious of the kitten’s story and motivations.

“No,” admitted Hellfire. “I wish I did. I do know he was an officer, and Annie’s last name is Guzman if that means anything to you guys.”

There was several seconds of silence as Nguyen, Pretty, and Gimsby suddenly looked at Lieutenant Wolfe. 

“Uh… did I say something wrong?” said Hellfire, sensing the tension in the air. 

The SEALs knew that their last team leader, Lieutenant Guzman, had a daughter. Her name was Annette but was nicknamed Annie. The team remained silent as Lieutenant Wolfe hefted up his weapon and moved towards the portal. 

Walking past a genuinely confused Hellfire, Lieutenant Wolfe said, “Let’s move. It’s time to end this.” 

Hellfire turned and scampered after the SEALs as they passed through the flaming portal suspended in the air. “Hey wait,” said Hellfire. “Do you know Annie? Did you know her dad?”

The SEALs emerged right where they started from when they first entered the Dungeon of More-Doom, a brightly lit corridor made of flat stones which led to a more brightly lit chamber.

“So, this is it, right Chief?” said Nguyen. “We beat the dungeon boss monster so we’re free to go, right?”

“I don’t think so, Terry,” answered Chief Pretty. “We didn’t defeat Cthulhu. The kitten did.”

“Wait,” said Nguyen. “So you’re saying there is a more deadly monster…”

“My beloved champions!” said the beautiful Dungeon Master smiling warmly with outstretched arms as the SEALs emerged from the corridor and into her throne room. “I knew that you would succeed where so many others had fallen! Welcome!”

“Gimsby,” whispered Lieutenant Wolfe, suddenly stepping aside.

“Got it,” said Gimsby, bringing the Dragunov to his shoulders and firing his last round.

The Dungeon Master’s angelically beautiful face snapped back as a neat little hole appeared in the middle of her forehead. Still standing, the Dungeon Master raised a shaking hand to her forehead, feeling the blood now dripping from her wound. She looked with disbelief at the blood now running down her soft, gentle fingers, her once pristine white gown now quickly being stained red. Her breath shuddered as she stared at Gimsby…

… and then she smiled.

“You… you did it!” Her smile widened and her eyes sparked brightly from a still lovely face now covered in blood. “You did it! Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I have waited centuries for warriors such as you to finally complete my mission! Thank you!”

“And just what was your mission?” said Wolfe, trying to hide his shock and disbelief that the Dungeon Master was still standing.

“Why, to die, of course,” smiled the Dungeon Master. “Well, not die, per se, but to pass into the next plain of existence. But, alas, in order for that to happen, one who is greater than I must open the door for me to pass. And you have done it, my dear, dear, champions! In return, great riches, treasure, wealth, fame, power, and long life will be awarded to you as it had been to me.”

“Yeah, baby, yeah!” yelled Hellfire as the beautiful form of the Dungeon Master began to slowly fade. “I did it! By bringing these guys back to your throne room, I killed the Dungeon Master! I’m finally the new Dungeon Master!”

“Oh, my silly little Hellfire,” said the rapidly fading Dungeon Master. “I shall miss you most of all. But I’m afraid that you cannot be the new Dungeon Master, for it was Gimsby the Barbarian who killed me.”

“WHAT??” screamed Hellfire. “Wait! Come back here!”

“Farewell my beloved Hellfire. I pray that you serve the new Dungeon Master well. And thank you again Ranger, Cavalier, Virgin, and especially you Barbarian! God bless the United States Navy SEALs!” And that was it. Those were the final words of the beautiful and ancient Dungeon Master before she finally faded away.

Dejectedly, the kitten slowly walked to Gimsby and prostrated himself at the boots of the big Navy SEAL.

“How may I serve you, oh Master of Dungeon More-Doom?”

“Cut the crap,” grunted Gimsby. “I can’t be the Dungeon Master, you idiot!”

Hellfire looked up, confusion etched all over his face. “What…what are you talking about?”

“Only people who are from this Realm are allowed enter the Dungeon,” said Nguyen. “It’s in the fucking rule book! Everything we did here is null and void!”

“And you knew this also, you Lou Ferrigno looking motherfucker?” said Hellfire, looking up to Gimsby.

“I’ve played the fantasy role playing game a few times when we were on standby,” answered Gimsby. “Terry usually acts as the Dungeon Master. My character is a barbarian named Arnold!”

“Nerds!” yelled Hellfire. “You’re all a bunch of testosterone fueled nerds!”

“Yeah,” said Nguyen. “But we got guns and shit!”

“Okay, cat,” said Lieutenant Wolfe. “That’s enough. You got what you wanted. You’re now the de facto new Dungeon Master. Now get us back to where we need to be. We still have a mission to complete.”

“Damn,” said Hellfire. “You guys are really intense. I gotta’ respect that. After all you’ve been through, you still want to go back to that hell hole and complete your mission? Why don’t you stick around a bit? Relax. Unwind. Now that I’m Dungeon Master, I can hook you guys up with the finest princesses in the Realm, or maybe females of another species if you’re into that freaky Captain Kirk shit.”

“Now, cat!” rumbled Chief Pretty.

“Okay, okay, sheesh!” Hellfire relented. “But I can’t let you go back empty handed. I gotta’ give you guys something. At least let the Virgin take a few of the prettier hobgoblins with him.”

“No thanks,” muttered Nguyen.

“You know,” said Lieutenant Wolfe. “There is one thing you can give us.”  
   
 

“Name it, Wolfie boy!”

“You can erase the memory of this place and these events from my men,” answered Lieutenant Wolfe. “We already have enough on our plates as it is. They don’t need to deal with the memories of what happened here.”

“Damn,” said Hellfire in sheer awe. “You guys are like a cheap date. I mean, that’s really all you want? To forget about this place?”

“Yup,” replied Wolfe.

“Okay, fella’s. You got it. But would you do me one small favor in return?”

“What do you want, cat?” said Wolfe, anxious to get back to the mission.

Hellfire snapped his paws and a black silken pouch appeared in Lieutenant Wolfe’s hand filled with solid gold coins and several diamonds.

“If you happen to run into a freckle faced little girl named Annie Guzman, would you give this to her? And tell her that her little Charlie still loves her and misses her.”

Epilogue

Though the SEALs had turned over the clearing of the cave to the Army Cavalry and EOD guys as well as a shit ton of intel folks, there were more questions than answers in the back of the CH-47 Chinook as the SEALs rode the short ride back to Kandahar Air Field.

“I’m telling you, Hilliard,” said Nguyen. “We were only gone for maybe a minute when you came running up behind us!”

“It can’t be, Terry!” Insisted Hilliard. “I searched for you for damn near an hour! I only found you guys right before the Army guys showed up!”

“What did you mean when you said you heard us talking to some woman and a kitten?” said Gimsby.

“I don’t know,” replied Hilliard. “You tell me! You guys were the ones having the conversation! And if you guys say you were only gone for a minute, why do all your watches read 1800 hours? It’s only one o’clock in the afternoon! It’s like you were gone for five hours!”

“That is kind of strange, sir,” said Nguyen, turning to Lieutenant Wolfe. “Just like my chem-light being found half way stuck inside the cave wall as if I had dropped it at a point where we walked through solid rock. You think them Wagner Group guys that we killed had anything to do with it? Maybe some mind altering drug to fuck with us?”

“I don’t know, Terry,” replied Lieutenant Wolfe. “For now, I’d just chalk it up to the fog of war.”

 Nguyen just nodded, then sat back in his seat, the steady rumbling of the Chinook suddenly making him very sleepy.

For his part, Lieutenant Wolfe looked across the cabin at his men. Hilliard sat staring at his feet, a contemplative look on his face, no doubt wracking his brain as to how he managed to walk right past his entire team in the close confines of that cave and not realize it. Nguyen’s head rested on Hilliard’s shoulder, the young SEAL fast asleep and mumbling something about not being a virgin. Gimsby also stared with a perplexed expression on his face, rotating his broken wrist and wondering how and when and why it was now as good as new. Also, why was the magazine of his Dragunov and several magazines of his Glock 19 pistol completely empty? Chief Pretty was seated behind the fifty caliber mounted at the open back ramp of the Chinook, ever on the lookout for danger.

“My second in command,” thought Lieutenant Wolfe. “The vigilant Cavalier.”

Wolfe slowly reached into his cargo pocket, feeling the softness of the black, silken, pouch. He knew that it was filled with gold and diamonds. He knew that it was for Annie, Lieutenant Guzman’s daughter. He even knew who gave it to him and how he came to receive it. Hellfire had kept his word to the SEALs. Hellfire did exactly what he was asked to do. He erased the memories of his men, but Lieutenant Wolfe had forgotten to specify to that little son of a bitch to erase his.

[Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, November 5](https://www.iswresearch.org/2022/11/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment_5.html )  
Wagner Group financier Yevheniy Prigozhin seeks to obfuscate his efforts to strengthen his independent power base with an appeal to the concept of Russia’s historic unity.  
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian confirmed that Iran began providing Russia drones before February 24, but strangely denied that Russian forces have used them in combat.  
DNR military commander Aleksandr Khodakovsky claimed that Russian friendly fire may have caused up to 60% of total Russian losses since mid-May.  
Ukrainian troops reportedly continued counteroffensives along the Svatove-Kreminna line.  
Russian forces continued to set up defensive positions along the Dnipro River.  
Ukrainian forces continued to target Russian logistics and transportation in Kherson Oblast.  
Russian forces continued to attack around Bakhmut and claimed unspecified advances.  
Russian forces continued unsuccessful offensive operations in the Avdiivka-Donetsk City area and in western Donetsk.  
Continued poor conditions for mobilized soldiers catalyzed a large-scale protest in Kazan.  
Unknown actors reportedly attempted to assassinate high-profile Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) Supreme Court Judge Aleksandr Nikulin.  
Russia continues to deploy personnel to staff administrative positions in occupied areas.  
Russian forces continued forced evacuations in Kherson Oblast. Over 80% of Kherson residents reportedly have evacuated.

&gt; Russia&amp;#039;s mercenary organization, Wagner, is facing legal action from a London-based law firm for its alleged &amp;quot;Terrorism&amp;quot; in what the firm says is an &amp;quot;Illegal war in Ukraine.""

&gt; Wagner operates as Russian President Vladimir Putin&amp;#039;s private army and has been accused of war crimes in the past.

&gt; &amp;quot;The current failure of the international community to effectively tackle Putin&amp;#039;s private army, Wagner, and its use of terrorism within his illegal war in Ukraine is a striking example of that.""

&gt; The law firm alleged that Wagner has used &amp;quot;Torture, murder and rape as weapons of war to terrorize civilian populations into submission&amp;quot; during Russia&amp;#039;s invasion of Ukraine.

&gt; The law firm also said that complaints against the private military group were first brought to U.K.&amp;#039;s High Court by Ukrainian victims, who launched legal action against the military group to seek &amp;quot;Accountability and reparations.""

&gt; In April, the Prosecutor General&amp;#039;s Office of Ukraine announced in a Facebook post that three members of Wagner were being investigated for alleged war crimes committed while Russia occupied the town of Motizhyn in March.

**IMPORTANT NOTES**


* NXT Champion Bron Breakker returns to NXT and makes his way to the ring. He say Halloween Havoc was a monumental night for NXT, not just for him but guys like NXT who climbed the ladder to become North American Champion, and Julius Creed, but he is quickly cut off by Pretty Deadly. They mock Bron for doing the same thing he always does when he barely holds onto his NXT Championship and asks where his next challenger his. Elton says Bron is the worst and they're sick of it. Bron puts on a false British accent and asks what the two wankers want. Elton says it was bad enough with Wes Lee last week and they don't need to hear it again. Kit says they defended their titles last week as well and asks where their parade is. Elton says they don't need Wes Lee's Hallmark movie when Wes Lee comes out and tells them to just shut up and thanks Bron for the appreciation. Kit says this should be about them right now but Bron tells him to stop bitching because of they weren't spending 3 hours combing their hair they could have been out there earlier. Wes says in fairness they do have great hair and after Bron inspects it he agrees. Bron says he'll step back and let them have the spotlight and Wes Lee does their introduction, calling Pretty Deadly two of the tastiest snacks in NXT and allows them to pose in the middle of the ring. As Kit thanks them Bron and Wes talk in the background as Pretty Deadly do the sideplate check. Bron says if you start the show someone is bound to interrupt them, and usually they're looking for those titles. Kit asks who that could be and Wes says it may as well be them. Lee says he misses the Tag Titles and Bron has never held it. Bron challenges them to put the titles on the line tonight. Elton accepts and says they'll be sending them home crying. Kit says opening the shows suck and this can't get any worst when R-Truth makes his way down to the ring and high fives Wes and Bron.

* During Truth vs Waller, R-Truth goes for a tope suicida over the top rope but doesn't fully clear the top rope and lands hard on the outside. He is checked by medics and is carried to the back. The match is called off. Waller gets on the mic and says he isn't surprised, it doesn't matter if it's NXT, Raw, or Smackdown, he is the best in this company and he just beat a 20 year vet all by himself. The crowd chants he got lucky but Waller says he gets lucky every single night because he's the best in this company.

*  Vic Joesph sits down with Schism for an interview. He says Ava Rain has been the talk of social media since she was revealed last week and everyone wants to know why Schism and why now. Ava says she showed everyone that they knew nothing, she had been around WWE her whole life and it wasn't until Schism that people got to know her. Ava says when she started training and got injured the only person who reached out to her was the new guy Joe Gacy. Even know Vic didn't ask anyone else why they joined Gacey. Joe says people have been asking Ava for things her whole life, things that they don't deserve, Schism accepted who she really is and were the first to do so. Fowler says since last week they have been under heightened scrutiny and tried to compare them to other groups past and present and asks Vic if he's ready to take off his mask. When asked about Cameron Grimes being sad Schism brainwashed Ava, she says she wasn't brain washed and that Grimes just thinks he's done with Schism because he paid some guys to win a match but you can't just walk away like that and he will face Grimes for the last time next week.

* Big Body Javi tells Edris and Enofe that they came close last week but they just weren't good enough and they should watch his match tonight to see how it's really done and tells them he hopes their meeting with Shawn Michaels goes well tonight. Edris asks how Javi got a match tonight when Odyssey Jones steps out of HBK's office and says he'll see Javi in the ring.

* Zoey Starks and Nikkita Lyons walk into the locker room pouting, Indi Hartwell asks what's wrong and says she lost last week too and you don't see her moping around and they are even getting a rematch meanwhile she hasn't had a title match in months. Zoey says title matches are earned not given out and clearly Indi hasn't earned anything recently. Indi says Zoey is about to earn her foot in her face and the two start to argue as the rest of the locker room separates them. 

* Backstage Andre Chase is hyping up Thea Hall before her match with Kiana James and she's getting pumped up but says something feels off and looks off to the flag, and wonders who's going to carry it. Duke Hudson bursts through a cardboard wall nearby and volunteers himself to carry it.

* During Kiana vs Thea Duke attempts to help Thea cheat by placing her leg on the rope to stop a rope break but Andre Chase yells at him for doing so, saying it goes against the code of conduct and sends him to the back. After the match Andre is checking on Thea when he's attacked from behind by Charley Dempsy but Duke runs back out to make the save and picks up Thea and Andre.

* Briggs and Jensen are backstage saying they are rooting for Bron and Wes tonight but regardless of who wins they want the next shot at the tag titles. During the interview Fallon Henley is handed an envelope that Kiana James had her assistant carry off earlier and is told to read it. 

* Backstage Wes Lee thanks Bron Breakker for stepping up and says winning the tag titles will be tough but it'll be even tougher holding both titles over their shoulders. Robert Stone approaches Bron Breakker and says he's worrying more about winning the tag titles than defending the NXT Title because he knows there's one guy he knows he can't beat on the roster, Von Wagner. Bron says next time Von better be the one sending his own message or his errand boy is gonna find his head in a locker.

* It's time for the 1 year celebration of Mandy Rose's title reign. Toxic Attraction make their way to the ring where they have pictures, couches, and champagne waiting for them. Jacey tells the crowd to bow in the presence of greatness, for 1 year she has proved everyone wrong and has been the baddest bitch in the game. Gigi says Mandy is untouchable and everyone doubted and didn't belief in her but she proved time and again that she is the best in that locker room, man or woman. Jacey says she has faced legends, under-dogs, and made Toxic Attraction the most decorated female faction in NXT and throws to a video package show casing Mandy's history in WWE. Mandy thanks them both and says all that isn't bad for a piece of eye-candy since that's all people thought she was for 4 years. People said she was a peach, a barbie doll, a centerfold bitch which is why she chose to bet on herself and return to NXT and it was the best decision of her life. With Gigi and Jacey Toxic Attraction have risen to the top and people thought she couldn't hold the NXT Women's Championship because the title represents the best women wrestlers in the world, and she's proven herself over the past year. She says she's given every woman in the division a shot at the title and she's walked over them all while wearing red bottoms and making it look good. She says it's felt good sitting on her throne for a year and she dares for anyone to knock her off. Smoke goes off at the front of the ring and Alba Fyre appears inside to destroy the display and super kicks Gigi and Jacey as Mandy escapes. She hits the Gory Bomb on Gigi through the table set up and warns Mandy that this week she took out Gigi, next week she takes out Jacey, and in two weeks she's taking her title. 

* Apollo Crews says Pretty Deadly got their moment in the sun but people want to see him vs Bron Breakker but he doesn't know if Bron wants it because he's a match-up problem for anyone on this roster. Since Apollo has returned Bron hasn't mentioned him once and is surprised he has to chase him down. Von Wagner says Apollo is a funny guy but calls himself the problem and warns Apollo not to go after Bron because he's challenging for the title next. 

* We hear another call from Scriptz who says they may be screening his calls but they can't screen his anger and that he will leave his mark on NXT as he spray paints the Performance Center.

* During Starks vs Indi, Zoey becomes a bit unhinged and is about to powerbomb Indi through the announce table when Nikkita tells her to calm down and beat Indi in the ring. Zoey throws her back in the ring where Indi is able to get the upperhand on a distracted Zoey.

Zoey attempts to attack them but Nikkita holds her back and says to save it for next week.

* After the main event Wes Lee hits a tope suicida to the outside to get to Carmelo Hayes and chases him to the back. As Bron stands in the ring Von Wagner attacks him from behind and lays him out.

🪖 [⚠️ Bakhmut](https://twitter.com/200_zoka/status/1587430301780873216), despite russian [warcrimes](https://twitter.com/TpyxaNews/status/1587440655864930307), and [☠️ hard battles](https://twitter.com/JimmySecUK/status/1587022437283233795), is  [🐶 Ukraine](https://twitter.com/small10space/status/1587464554761551872).

🥷 Someone really doesn’t like the occupied [Kherson police station](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1587222563427684352.html) which was attacked for a third time.

🛩 Near Bakhmut, Ukraine [shot down](https://twitter.com/EPICGOPFAIL/status/1587282111270092800) a Belarusian donated helicopter being used to [ferry Wagner mercenary group officers](https://twitter.com/Flash_news_ua/status/1587439651568386049).  There were no survivors of the crash.  Before Ukraine released the video, russian propagandists were [adamant it was a Ukrainian helicopter](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1587120131221643266) which had been shot down.

👉 The weather has slowed down Ukraine’s Kherson offensive and the wait is becoming [increasingly difficult](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1587497870017675265.html) for residents.  russia continues to withdraw and is creating a [15km buffer](https://twitter.com/vidtranslator/status/1587356911686533120) to the east of the [Dnipro river](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1587149196267819009).  russia has also [turned off internet and mobile service](https://twitter.com/GirkinGirkin/status/1587381513536028673) in many areas west of the Dnipro.

👉 On Monday, russia hit Ukraine with [another massive missile and drone swarm](https://twitter.com/euromaidanpress/status/1587042952068489218) that putin said was [💭 “partly” in response](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1587194099425214466) to the attacks on the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, occupied Crimea.   During the attack, the IRIS-T air-defense system was [100% successful](https://twitter.com/markito0171/status/1587139211462844416) in [bringing down](https://twitter.com/NOELreports/status/1586974199901478913) the incoming missiles in its area.  Unfortunately, Ukraine has only one of these systems right now so [several missiles](https://twitter.com/mrsorokaa/status/1587018205905780736) did [manage to hit their targets](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1586996493419945985.html) elsewhere.  In a rather remarkable story, one of the missiles was shot down by eleven Ukrainian defenders using only [small arms fire](https://twitter.com/TDF_UA/status/1586986527338496000).

👉 The attack, estimated to have consumed [💭 $760 million dollars](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1587491307953455109) worth of missiles, was largely [targeted](https://twitter.com/Biz_Ukraine_Mag/status/1586996504929177601) at electrical [infrastructure](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1587174158299004928.html) and managed to [disrupted power](https://twitter.com/maria_avdv/status/1587187857927577600) for a few hours in several regions of Ukraine.  Ukraine’s energy company has said it is [💭 running out of equipment](https://twitter.com/kyivindependent/status/1587121403186364418) and repair costs are in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

👉 During Monday’s missile assault ANOTHER russian missile [flew over Moldovan territory](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1587036599300366336.html) and either malfunctioned or [was shot down](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1587012395729305601) by Ukraine air defense and [landed in Moldova](https://twitter.com/MihaiPopsoi/status/1587106721926987776).  The missile was on course for a hydroelectric dam, which, if breached, would have flooded parts of Moldova.   As you can imagine, Moldova was **NOT** happy, and [expelled the russian ambassador](https://twitter.com/nicupopescu/status/1587112473295032322).

👉 Kremlin Spokesman [Dmitry Peskov said](https://twitter.com/NOELreports/status/1587402254843248641) that Britain’s participation in the attacks in Sevastopol and on the Nord Streams cannot be left just like that and Moscow will think about further steps.  The “Britain organized the Sevastopol and Nord Stream attacks” story is one of the many, many disinformation campaigns russia is currently undertaking.  russia is also unhappy that [💭 Canadian-manufactured navigation modules](https://twitter.com/SamRamani2/status/1587095323612258304) were found in some of the UAV’s that were shot down.

👉 putin may have had a grand ceremony to announce the end of mobilization but, as has been widely suspected, [putin reneged](https://twitter.com/vidtranslator/status/1587485547995471874) and mobilization [continues as usual](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1587129935507881985.html) outside of Moscow and St. Petersburg as Chechnya announces the [💭 continuation of mobilization](https://twitter.com/Flash_news_ua/status/1587374003592773633).  Also, russians who evade the draft, can be fined 500,000 rubles or [sentenced to 5 years in prison](https://twitter.com/meduza_en/status/1587344794271027201).

🌾 After a [strong backlash](https://twitter.com/PowerUSAID/status/1587467063160983554), putin [backtracked](https://twitter.com/exit266/status/1587145173900955649) and said it’s [only suspending](https://twitter.com/GlasnostGone/status/1587344279038476289), not ending, its participation in the grain deal.  [Turkey](https://twitter.com/Flash_news_ua/status/1587033946109448194), the UN, and Ukraine continued their participation and [traffic continued as usual](https://twitter.com/OlKubrakov/status/1586991698944614401) — ignoring russia’s threats as shipments resumed.

🌾 While Ukrainians were quick to declare a victory as ships continued along the grain corridor without russia’s consent, putin did put in a reminder of how [difficult life can be without an agreement](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1587204027292569601) in place as it fired on a tugboat transporting grain — killing 2, with 1 wounded and 1 missing.  russia said [💭 it would return](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1587519039705939969.html) to the grain deal if an investigation into the Sevastopol attacks was instigated and Ukraine agrees not to use the corridor for military purposes.  In russia’s absence, Ukrainian grain will be [shipped under a Turkish flag](https://twitter.com/tcsavunma/status/1587535515997204480).

👉 A little more information on Viacheslav Bohuslaev, head of Ukrainian aerospace company Motor Sich surfaced after his arrest for treason.

👉 Traffic on the Kerch Strait bridge is [still severely restricted](https://twitter.com/vidtranslator/status/1587200847271927809).

Now ferries can only transit [800 cars a day](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1587167853412847616.html) and traffic across the bridge is restricted to 250 cars an hour — 6,000 a day.

✊🌻 Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by [western government reports](https://twitter.com/defencehq/status/1553040194680623104) and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.   Currently russia’s goal is to capture the Donetsk Oblast and retain control of the Luhansk Oblast, both tasks it is currently failing.  russia has been [downgrading its stated objectives](https://twitter.com/WarintheFuture/status/1547375127272235010) since its retreat from Kyiv.

🇺🇦 Current state of the war: russia has ~25k troops trapped between Ukrainian forces and the Dnipro river in Kherson to the south.  Ukraine has also mounted a successful [counter-offensive in Kharkiv](https://twitter.com/bradyafr/status/1569140110402244608) that has seen russian forces [driven from the region](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1569243133925367809) and now threatens months of painful russian advances in the Donbas area.  russia has been unable to mount any serious offensive operations since July.  Currently the advantage rests decisively with Ukraine.

t3_ynl749,04:16.0,Mr_OTG,BettermentBookClub,What Got You Here Won’t Get You There by Marshall Goldsmith,"Hi There,  

I am in a phase of rereading books that have impacted me.

And What Got You Here Won’t Get You There by Marshall Goldsmith is one of them.

Marshall’s mission is to help successful people become better. 

## The Method

He doesn’t deal with strategy, finance, technique, or technology.

He focuses on only one thing: behavior.

Having coached the world’s greatest CEOs, he concluded that the higher you go, the less it’s about technical competencies. 

### But changing behavior as an adult (even more so when you are successful) is one of the most difficult tasks.

We tend to associate our success with everything we do. Including our bad behaviors.

“I got here by not listening much. It’s certainly because it saves me time.”

Marshall’s role, reinforcing good beliefs and changing bad ones.

He has developed a unique method of stakeholder-based coaching. He interviews the people around (pro and personal), choose with the leader the behavior to be improved based on the feedback, and organizes the follow-up for 12 to 18 months.

The result. The leaders improve.

And finally, the book is for all of us. Because we all have behaviors to change.

## 4 ideas that stuck with me

### 1 – Winning too much

Our need to win, when there is something at stake and when there is not. Marshall gives the example of dinner with friends. You argue about which restaurant to select. The group’s way wins and it wasn’t your choice.

The meal and the place are not great.

You have two options, you let it go and try to make the most of the evening. Or you remind everyone, on every occasion, that you were right and we should have listened to you.

How would you have acted?

### 2 – Adding too much value

— That’s a good idea, but it would be even better if you add that element.

*“The problem is, you may have improved the content of my idea by 5 percent, but you’ve reduced my commitment to executing it by 50 percent because you’ve taken away my ownership of the idea. My idea is now your idea-and I walk out of your office less enthused about it than when I walked in.”*

 

### 3 – Starting with No, But, or However…

A disguised way of saying, “I’m right, you’re wrong”.

By reducing their use, you also reduce unnecessary conflicts.

&amp;#x200B;

### 4 – Feedforward Vs Feedback.

The concept of feedback is as old as time. Marshall found a way to turn it around. Why is this?

When you give feedback:

* You refer to the past.
* The person receiving it tends to take it personally.
* You can’t change anything that has already happened

On the other hand, “Feedforward” asks for a suggestion for the future. I want to improve in this area, give me two ideas that I could put into practice in the future. 

And this method can be used at home too:

* “What can I do to be a better partner at home?
* “What can I do to be a better parent? (I tried it with my children, and the answers are interesting)
* “What can I do to be a better son?

I like the metaphor used by Marshall’s partner Frank Wagner.

The rearview mirror is tiny, the windshield is huge.

In October of 2022, the group Wagner helped to create a mass grave in Mali in order to accuse France of war crimes. This comes after years of tension between the two countries. France has been accused of not doing enough to stop the spread of terrorism in the region. Wagner is a Russian private military company that has been active in the region for some time.

In recent years, there has been an increase in terrorist activity in the region. This has led to a increase in French military presence in the region. However, this has not been enough to stop the spread of terrorism. The group Wagner believes that the only way to stop the spread of terrorism is to remove France from the region entirely.

The group Wagner is made up of former Russian soldiers. They are believed to be working for the Kremlin. In the past, they have been accused of working with the Russian government to destabilize other countries.

The mass grave that was found in Mali is believed to be the work of the group Wagner. It is believed that they wanted to use the mass grave to frame France for war crimes.

The tension between France and the group Wagner is likely to increase in the coming weeks.

A daring Iranian woman was spotted walking through a parking lot without a hijab, prompting outrage among the public.

The unnamed woman was photographed by Goypride, an Iranian news outlet, walking through a shopping center parking lot in the city of Mashhad. She was not wearing a hijab, a traditional headscarf that is required by law for women in Iran.

The photo quickly sparked outrage on social media, with many Iranians condemning the woman for her ""immoral"" and ""un-Islamic"" behavior. Some even called for her to be arrested and punished.

Despite the backlash, the woman has remained defiant, telling Goypride that she ""will not be forced to wear a hijab"" and that she ""should be able to choose what to wear.""

The incident highlights the tensions between hardline conservatives and more liberal Iranians, who are increasingly challenging the country's strict Islamic laws. It also comes as the Iranian government has been cracking down on women who do not wear hijabs in public, with several women being arrested and sentenced to prison in recent months.

&gt; KYIV - Ukraine&amp;#039;s so-called IT army has executed cyberattacks on around 8,000 Russian resources, successfully targeting the defense industry and countering disinformation campaigns by state-sponsored outlets, according to Ukraine&amp;#039;s deputy minister of digital transformation.

&gt; Ukraine&amp;#039;s IT army, estimated to number around 215,000, is an anonymous group predominantly made up of volunteers, Dubynskyi said.

&gt; Operating through the messaging app Telegram, the cyber army targets Russian state-sponsored media outlets &amp;quot;Spreading disinformation in brainwashing their own population,&amp;quot; as well as financial drivers of the war.

&gt; &amp;quot;If you stop their activity at least for one day, many lives of our citizens and soldiers are saved,&amp;quot; said Dubynskyi, referring to funding from sources such as Russian energy firm Gazprom.

&gt; The IT army has also successfully attacked the website of the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization, to delete large amounts of data, he added.

&gt; Dubynskyi has accused Russia of using tools, such as artificial intelligence, to create &amp;quot;Sophisticated fake news&amp;quot; to spread disinformation to Africa, the Middle East, South America, India, and China to gain support at the United Nations.

&gt; A day before the United States votes in midterm elections, the founder of Russia&amp;#039;s Wagner Group, a private mercenary force, has admitted to interfering in US elections and promised to continue.

&gt; &amp;quot;We have interfered, we are interfering and we will continue to interfere - carefully, accurately, surgically and in our own way, as we know how to do,&amp;quot; Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Monday in comments posted by the press service of his Concord catering firm on Russian social media.

&gt; Prigozhin usually keeps a low public profile but has become more outspoken in the course of the Ukraine war and has criticised Russian generals.

&gt; On Friday, the Wagner Group opened a defence technology centre in St Petersburg, a further step by Prigozhin to highlight his military credentials and take a more public role in Russia&amp;#039;s defence policy.

&gt; Prigozhin owns a network of companies and is often referred to as &amp;quot;Putin&amp;#039;s chef&amp;quot; because his catering company has Kremlin contracts.

&gt; In July, the US State Department offered a reward of up to $10m for information on Prigozhin in connection with &amp;quot;Engagement in US election interference.""

[Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, November 6](https://www.iswresearch.org/2022/11/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment_6.html )  
Key Kremlin officials began collectively deescalating their rhetoric regarding the use of nuclear weapons in early November.  
The Kremlin’s rhetorical shift indicates that senior Russian military commanders and elements of the Kremlin are likely to some extent aware of the massive costs for little operational gain Russia would incur for the use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine or NATO.  
The Kremlin likely privately clarified its nuclear policies to deescalate with the United States and its allies.  
Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin confirmed on November 6 that the Wagner Group is creating training and management centers for local “people’s militias” in Kursk and Belgorod oblasts.[18]  
Russian milbloggers amplified reports that the Russian 155th Naval Infantry Brigade sustained severe losses during the recent offensive push towards Pavlivka, Donetsk Oblast.[19]  
Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the direction of Svatove and Kreminna.[20]  
Russian opposition sources reported that Ukrainian shelling near Makiivka, Luhansk Oblast may have killed up to 500 Russian mobilized personnel in one day.[21]  
Russian forces continued establishing defensive positions on the west (right) bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast.[22] Ukrainian forces continued their interdiction campaign against Russian logistics in Kherson Oblast.[23]  
Russian forces conducted ground attacks near Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Vuhledar.[24] Russian sources claimed that Russian forces broke through Ukrainian defenses near Bakhmut, made marginal gains south of Avdiivka, and remained impaled near Pavliivka in western Donetsk Oblast.[25]  
Ukrainian personnel repaired two external power lines to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) on November 5, resuming the supply of electricity to the ZNPP after shelling deenergized the facility on November 3.[26]  
Russian occupation officials continued to cite the threat of a Ukrainian strike on the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station to justify the continued forced relocation of civilians in Kherson Oblast.[27]  
Russian occupation officials continued to forcibly transfer Ukrainian children from occupied Ukraine to Russia under the guise of “vacation” schemes.[28]  
Russian forces continued to struggle with domestic resistance to and poor provisioning of ongoing mobilization efforts.

*****
&gt; Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly approved the evacuation of civilians from parts of Russian-occupied Kherson in southern Ukraine.

&gt; Mr Putin&amp;#039;s comments followed reports on Thursday that Russian soldiers, too, had been leaving Kherson - in what would mark a major withdrawal.

&gt; Civilians were first urged to leave Kherson in the middle of last month, as the Russian army switched the city to defensive mode.

&gt; Russia claims the Kherson region and three other Ukrainian regions as its own territory, though it does not fully control any of them.

&gt; Of these, Mr Putin said 49,000 were already involved in active fighting - a figure not independently verified by the BBC. Meanwhile, a Russian private military company, the Wagner Group, has opened its first official headquarters, in St Petersburg.

&gt; Mr Putin has now amended the Russian law on calling up reservists to include men convicted of serious crimes who recently left prison.

📝 With the Holiday season fast approaching and the absolute carnival of chaos on Twitter between the US elections, Elon Musk and a flood of russian disinformation bots, there will be days ahead where it will not be possible to produce a report.

And /u/SaberFlux has the [daily personal observations](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/yng3b3/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/ivbht82/) from the city of Kharkiv.

🪖 [Bakhmut](https://twitter.com/TpyxaNews/status/1588999540534759425), [Ukraine](https://twitter.com/Maks_NAFO_FELLA/status/1588496068714848256) — [warcrimed](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1588367539880734725) again.

🪖 In [Pavlivka](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1588643227581943808), north of Mariupol, Ukraine intelligence found out the russians were preparing a [major attack](https://twitter.com/warnerta/status/1589259840488345603) and re-enforced the Ukrainian troops to handle it.  Rather than abort, the russians [went ahead with the attack anyway](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1589355573770080256) and [not only failed](https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1589003470040100869) in the attack but [sustained crippling losses](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589246948816875521.html ) and a contingent are stuck and [unable to withdraw](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1589338243736416256).  The russian assault was so [badly bungled](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589285318762856448.html) that the soldiers who survived are demanding an [independent commission](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589300375583981569.html) to investigate.  A forward Ukrainian position here was overrun and the [video they made](https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1588969867138715649) shows why russia will never win — [the men survived](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1588535786206826499).

🪖 In Makiivka, Luhansk a battalion of newly mobilized russians were obliterated by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.  Out of [570 only 41 survived](https://twitter.com/TWMCLtd/status/1589009876910768129) after commanders moved them to the front lines with just [three shovels](https://twitter.com/ItsArtoir/status/1589066425075126273), told them to dig trenches, and then abandoned them.  Without training, they stayed grouped together and without shovels they were unable to dig cover, and were easily dispatched by Ukrainian artillery.  Relatives of the men [petitioned the prosecutor’s](https://twitter.com/TWMCLtd/status/1589016380719828992) office in Voronezh, russia to help.

☢️🍿 External [power has been restored](https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1589021026461130752) to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.  The plant was relying on its diesel generators to cool its nuclear fuel [for two days](https://twitter.com/iaeaorg/status/1588934626004807680).

🥷 In Belgorod, russia, an [oil plant is on fire](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1589205843517448192).

🥷 Partisans in russia are [burning switchboards and electrical substations](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589036399495614464.html) on russia’s railways to make russian logistics even more difficult.

🥷 Partisans from the Free Russia Legion set [fire to fuel tankers](https://twitter.com/PStyle0ne1/status/1588940468163084288) in Yekaterinburg, russia.

🥷  A russian installed judge in the Donetsk region, who sentenced [three fighters](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1588929303194263555.html) in the Ukrainian foreign legion to death, is in [critical condition](https://twitter.com/meduza_en/status/1588929800672280577) following an [assassination attempt](https://twitter.com/euromaidanpress/status/1589199662883274752).

🥷 In occupied Donetsk, the city unveiled a signpost saying “To russia 0km”, [by the evening it had disappeared](https://twitter.com/TWMCLtd/status/1588598523271909377).  Also, in occupied Kherson, some signs are receiving [a Ukrainian  color makeover](https://twitter.com/TWMCLtd/status/1588603243827167232).

👉 Part of the reason russia may be experiencing higher than normal casualties is because the mobilized russians are being shot at by the Ukrainians from the front and their [fellow russians in the back](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1588418615207989249.html) as russia combats low moral by forcing their troops to advance and die or be shot trying to retreat.

👉  In the [Kherson area](https://twitter.com/Maks_NAFO_FELLA/status/1589328801724796928), there is [favorable weather](https://twitter.com/davidhelms570/status/1589303553923121152) for the next few days and we’re [seeing media](https://twitter.com/praisethesteph/status/1589058780285005825) of Ukrainian forces [getting ready to move](https://twitter.com/DemeryUK/status/1589043475865272321).  Nobody knows what the russians have planned.  They are [still](https://twitter.com/TWMCLtd/status/1588941347700232194) looting [everything](https://twitter.com/lukeharding1968/status/1588913945544359937) that’s [not nailed down](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1589356744500686848) and there are reports they are [burning their ammo](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1589336406412828672) and equipment on the west bank.   Still, there are still signs that [russia intends to fight](https://twitter.com/WarMonitor3/status/1588985118856994816) and are absolutely going to fight for the [eastern bank](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1588924419002740736.html).  With the civilian occupational authorities evacuated, stores in the area have already ditched the ruble and [switched back to Ukrainian Hryvnias](https://twitter.com/NOELreports/status/1589220755577143297).

🌊 When russia retreated from Kharkiv they [blew up the floodgates](https://twitter.com/wammezz/status/1588848829105082369) at the Oskil reservoir which has [now run dry](https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1588649775393820672), impacting fisheries and power generation.  Previously russia laid [175kg of TNT](https://twitter.com/irmachep/status/1576504797116522496) next to the dam in Velyki, and blew up the dam at [Kryyvyi Rih](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1570109515651227648) and is believed to have mined the dam at [Nova Kakhovka](https://twitter.com/Apex_WW/status/1583223215685791745). 

❄️ The [💭 first real snows](https://twitter.com/Flash_news_ua/status/1589276613220663296) of the [season](https://twitter.com/bocapoIis/status/1588852561289043968) will be hitting Ukraine soon and while there has been a lot of focus on the electrical situation in Kyiv and Lviv, the real tragedy of russia’s terrorism will be the towns on the frontlines where russia shells the power lines and then [doesn’t allow the lines to be repaired](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589336305238159360.html).

⚡ Due to russia’s terrorism, there are still [rolling blackouts](https://twitter.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1589015879337267201) in Ukraine.  With Kyiv expecting blackouts [💭 32% more than expected](https://twitter.com/kyivindependent/status/1589367229455290368) on Monday.  While there are plans to set up [communal heating stations](https://twitter.com/With__Ukraine/status/1498001127723257857) to keep people warm in an emergency, there are also plans to [evacuate Kyiv](https://twitter.com/sergeykovalenko/status/1589153004300734469) if the electricity will be out for too long, though that [isn’t expected anytime soon](https://twitter.com/kyivindependent/status/1589262049162719233).  Even though [seventeen EU countries](https://twitter.com/eu_echo/status/1588555699600396289) are rushing to help Ukraine rebuild its power-grid, russia keeps targeting the infrastructure and Ukraine presently doesn’t have enough air-defenses to stop it.

🏴‍☠️ We’re getting [more](https://twitter.com/NOELreports/status/1588670196830830594) and [more reports](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1588992762380419073) of mutiny in the ranks of russia’s mobilized.  The main issues seem to be [failure to be paid](https://twitter.com/TpyxaNews/status/1589296535715844096).  Although [putin promised a bonus](https://twitter.com/Apex_WW/status/1588260247931858945), it wouldn’t be the first time mobilized russians were just [given lip service](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1588849891283177472.html) — after all, why give mobilized men good weapons when you can just [jail the journalist and suppress the video](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1588672503832268800.html).  Things are even worse for the families of the [Moskva crew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1588457673468833794.html) as russia struggles with [delinquent military payments](https://twitter.com/thestudyofwar/status/1589301664590225410).

👉 The mobilized men in Ukraine are being subjected to [illegal imprisonment](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589258686140420098.html) and [torture](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589250189906169856.html).  They also risk [friendly fire](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1589201692691951616) just picking up supplies.  Meanwhile, the talking heads back in russia think [only young men without wives](https://twitter.com/JuliaDavisNews/status/1589035403105173504) should be sent so the state won’t have to pay pensions, but russia doesn’t pay anyway because “[No body - no problem](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1589002574963048448)”.   russia seems to like prisoners who have [committed serious crimes](https://twitter.com/Apex_WW/status/1588523629578420225) too.

⚰️ In occupied Luhansk, the [cemeteries are so full](https://twitter.com/TWMCLtd/status/1589256236897566721) that they’ve started burying their soldiers at the side of the road.

🥶 while putin [drones on about brotherly warmth](https://twitter.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1588659521127583746) towards Ukrainians, people in occupied Mariupol put signs outside their apartments [begging for windows and heat](https://twitter.com/euromaidanpress/status/1588619775856750592).

⚰️ Built on [hundreds of corpses](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1588587460296335360.html), [Wagner PMC Center](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1586952994456838145.html) opens in St. Petersburg with a [grand opening ceremony](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1588992548760350720) and the story doesn’t end there as the [construction is a bit storied](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1588560194702696448.html).

✊🌻 Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by [western government reports](https://twitter.com/defencehq/status/1553040194680623104) and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.   Currently russia’s goal is to capture the Donetsk Oblast and retain control of the Luhansk Oblast, both tasks it is currently failing.  russia has been [downgrading its stated objectives](https://twitter.com/WarintheFuture/status/1547375127272235010) since its retreat from Kyiv.

🇺🇦 Current state of the war: russia has ~25k troops trapped between Ukrainian forces and the Dnipro river in Kherson to the south.  Ukraine has also mounted a successful [counter-offensive in Kharkiv](https://twitter.com/bradyafr/status/1569140110402244608) that has seen russian forces [driven from the region](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1569243133925367809) and now threatens months of painful russian advances in the Donbas area.  russia has been unable to mount any serious offensive operations since July.  Currently the advantage rests decisively with Ukraine.

##ISW
-[Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, November 7](https://www.iswresearch.org/2022/11/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment_7.html )  
The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) issued a rare statement on November 7 in response to extensive Russian milblogger outcry about reported extensive losses and poor command within the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Pacific Fleet.  
The Russian pro-war siloviki faction (including Yevgeny Prigozhin and Ramzan Kadyrov) is increasing its influence in part to advance personal interests in Russia and occupied Ukraine, not strictly to win the war.  
Russian forces have greatly depleted their arsenal of high-precision weapons systems and have suffered significant aviation losses and will likely struggle to maintain the current pace of the Russian military’s coordinated campaign against Ukrainian critical infrastructure.  
Russian occupation authorities likely began a new phase of evacuations from Kherson Oblast.  
Russian troops continued efforts to fix Ukrainian troops against the international border in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast.  
Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian troops continued counteroffensive operations in the Svatove direction.

✅ Tuesday is election day in the US.  While a [slim majority of Republican members support Ukraine](https://twitter.com/AaronBlake/status/1588129623161839617), Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy has stated Ukraine will face a [hard time getting funded](https://twitter.com/connorobrienNH/status/1582357284147015681) if Republicans win the house. 

🗺️ Ukraine has [liberated 50%](https://twitter.com/JayinKyiv/status/1589520344888377344) of the territory russia occupied in 2022.

🪖 [🔗 ISW](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-november-7), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589681687235297280.html), and [📺 Reporting from Ukraine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFAKC7bWOv8) have the daily border reports.  Here is Tim White’s [daily thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589493796089495554.html).   Here are the [🔗 daily attrition statistics](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/dfbcec47-7b01-400e-ab21-de8eb98c8f3a/page/IzToC).   And /u/SaberFlux has the [daily personal observations](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/yoc4en/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/ivgb5ph/) from the city of Kharkiv.

🪖 On Monday, russia launched an [all-out assault](https://twitter.com/UATV_en/status/1589585958910906368) on [Bakhmut](https://twitter.com/UkrainianNews24/status/1589701206955343873) and despite the usual false reports from russia, the city is [still held by Ukraine](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1589722422781280256).  On an ordinary day, russia [loses 100 soldiers in Bakhmut](https://twitter.com/NOELreports/status/1589741634568466432), likely those numbers will increase greatly after the latest assaults.

🪖 As hard as the russians tried for Bakhmut today, they tried just as hard to capture Bilohorivka where the battles raged.  There’s no official reports to go by yet, but Warmappers [Andrew](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1589722087241187328) and [Def Mon](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1589681721825320960) have thoughts.

🪖 [Kherson](https://twitter.com/TpyxaNews/status/1589542778341851137), still waits…

🍄 In occupied Donetsk the [railway administration building burned](https://twitter.com/Worldsource24/status/1589539273724022784) down after it was shelled by Ukraine.  russia didn’t have any water to fight the fire.  Firefighters did manage to hook up a hose to a nearby railway reteviour but by then it was too late to contain the blaze.  The fire lasted [six hours](https://twitter.com/TWMCLtd/status/1589509103520731136).

☢️🍿 Officials at the Beloyarsk Nuclear Power Plant in russia have [denied reports of a fire](https://twitter.com/TWMCLtd/status/1589508572630888449) at the facility.  So everything is fine citizen, carry on.

☢️🍿 While talking heads on russian TV continue to [argue for their own destruction](https://twitter.com/JuliaDavisNews/status/1589680357380861958) in a nuclear war, russia’s rhetoric on use of nuclear weapons has [notably diminished](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589511747789942784.html) since their Foreign Ministry [published a statement](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1587803851356311553.html) indicating they wouldn’t be used.  russia isn’t even shelling the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant any more.

🛩 Ukraine has confirmed that NASAM anti-aircraft systems from the US and Norway, and [Aspide anti-aircraft systems](https://twitter.com/ukraine_map/status/1589614581873139712) from Spain [have arrived in Ukraine](https://twitter.com/oleksiireznikov/status/1589571269363904512), providing a larger protective cover for the country.  Six more NASAM systems are being built for Ukraine and will be delivered in the months ahead.  The West has also been supplying the mothballed HAWK systems which are ideal for shooting down the slower drones.  The NASAMS are the only air defense systems Ukraine has that can offer some protection against [Iranian ballistic missiles](https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/status/1589584171667800071).

👉 There’s some follow up about russian losses at Pavlivka as an author claims the losses are [far higher](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1589717120103108609) than reported by russia’s Ministry of Defense.  russia’s propaganda department scrounged up,  perhaps, the last three surviving members of the 155^th brigade to let everyone know [everything is fine](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1589735873444450306) and not to panic — really,  [everything is fine](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589549893059846144.html).

👉 The art russia stole from the Kherson museum has been [found in Simferopol, occupied Crimea](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589643110858264580.html).

👉 The geolocators have discovered a [cache of stolen Ukrainian ships](https://twitter.com/NLwartracker/status/1589614134122844160) of more than [20 vessels](https://twitter.com/Whiny_Nihilist/status/1589630727158919168).  The purpose and use right now is just speculation.

👉 Ukraine is starting to have a new problem: [Too many POWs](https://twitter.com/Teoyaomiquu/status/1589513453274042369).

👉 Satellite images show [1,500 new graves](https://twitter.com/GlasnostGone/status/1589521744355655681) in [Mariupol](https://twitter.com/GlasnostGone/status/1589537260445175808).

🇷🇺 russia is creating minefields in russia because it believes Ukraine won’t stop at the internationally recognized borders.  And [several russian soldiers and border guards have died](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589611131349635073.html) due to mines on russian territory.

🇷🇺 Yevgeny Prigozhin the Oligarch head of the Wagner Mercenary group, on US Midterem [💭 election interference](https://twitter.com/SamRamani2/status/1589591125215825920): “Gentlemen, [we interfered](https://twitter.com/IlvesToomas/status/1589627985757634561), we interfere,  and we will interfere.  Carefully, precisely, surgically and in our own way; [💭 we know how to do it](https://twitter.com/JuliaDavisNews/status/1589619822195011592)”.  Prigozhin is already wanted by the US for interference in the 2016 elections and has a [ten million dollar bounty on his head](https://twitter.com/UkrainianNews24/status/1589641338899042306).

🇷🇺 russian warships from Vladivostok, which were supposed to be used to shell Ukraine, were never allowed into the Black Sea by Turkey and [are returning home](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589610548366540800.html).

🇷🇺 russia has begun [moving a newly constructed span](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589729591668535296.html) for the repair of the Kerch Strait bridge.

🇺🇦 Ukrainian President Zelensky has [laid out his demands for peace](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1589742078506192897) negotiations.  They include, restoring territorial integrity, respect for the UN charter, compensation for damages, punishment of war criminals, and guarantees it won’t happen again. 

🇺🇦 Ukraine has said it is building [a second “Mriya”](https://twitter.com/NOELreports/status/1589699184734900224) aircraft after [the first](https://twitter.com/IAPonomarenko/status/1589683827303383041) was destroyed by russia at the start of the war.  The Mriya was the world’s largest cargo aircraft.  Reports say that the new aircraft is already [30% complete](https://twitter.com/torikoos/status/1589702694859464704).

🇮🇷 Iran is believed to have transferred medium range [ballistic missiles](https://twitter.com/NieblaGuerra/status/1589635581201776643) to occupied [Crimea](https://twitter.com/bradyafr/status/1589661651435163648) and they will be ready to launch at Ukrainian targets “soon”.   Fortunately the NASAMS recently installed by Ukraine will offer some protection but Ukraine will require far more of these systems to increase the area of protection.  A report in the Guardian indicates that Iran’s supply of weapons to russia is creating a split, but [don’t get your hopes up](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589767728508055553.html) that anything will change soon.

🇭🇺 With the EU preparing an €18 billion dollar aid package that will help Ukraine’s war-torn economy by providing €1.5 billion euros a month next year, Hungary has decided [it will not be helping Ukraine](https://twitter.com/Flash_news_ua/status/1589709753202012161).

💰🇷🇺 russia has reported that [Lancôme UK](https://twitter.com/LancomeUK),  [Saint Laurent](https://twitter.com/YSL), [Armani](https://twitter.com/armani), and [Redkin](https://twitter.com/Redken5thAve) have agreed to resume shipping products to russia.  These companies won’t be alone, [several large western countries are complicit](https://twitter.com/MFA_Ukraine/status/1589567352328241153) in the war and since the mobilization of russia’s economy, complicit in the war crimes.

💰🇷🇺 How much the war and mobilization has [🔗 cost each region in russia](https://threadreaderapp-com.translate.goog/thread/1589566215546339329.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp). 

💰🇸🇰 Slovakia has been [🔗 shipping “duel use” parts to russia](https://www-irozhlas-cz.translate.goog/zpravy-svet/zasobovani-ruska-slovensko-vinohradska-12-matej-skalicky_2211070600_kac?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp) that has been helping russia wage war.  The exports also include bearings through Iran — a crisis component russia needs to keep its railways running.

💰🇺🇦 Ukraine [🔗  has nationalized](https://www-epravda-com-ua.translate.goog/news/2022/11/7/693528/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp) the businesses of [several oligarchs](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589796777309659137.html) accused of helping russia.

🎁🇧🇪 Belgium, which just recently voted to directly provide aid to Ukraine, has handed over a [large batch of military trucks](https://twitter.com/Maks_NAFO_FELLA/status/1589595332673142784) and 4 120mm mortars.

✊🌻 Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by [western government reports](https://twitter.com/defencehq/status/1553040194680623104) and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.   Currently russia’s goal is to capture the Donetsk Oblast and retain control of the Luhansk Oblast, both tasks it is currently failing.  russia has been [downgrading its stated objectives](https://twitter.com/WarintheFuture/status/1547375127272235010) since its retreat from Kyiv.

🇺🇦 Current state of the war: russia has ~25k troops trapped between Ukrainian forces and the Dnipro river in Kherson to the south.  Ukraine has also mounted a successful [counter-offensive in Kharkiv](https://twitter.com/bradyafr/status/1569140110402244608) that has seen russian forces [driven from the region](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1569243133925367809) and now threatens months of painful russian advances in the Donbas area.  russia has been unable to mount any serious offensive operations since July.  Currently the advantage rests decisively with Ukraine.

In 2011, Forsen won first place in the E-Sport SM May Qualifier and was the runner-up in the E-Sport SM October Qualifier, earning a total of 3,500 [Swedish krona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_krona) ($382.50) and qualifying for the Swedish National Championships in [*StarCraft II*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-6) In 2012, Forsen garnered attention by advancing to the final group stage of the 2012 [DreamHack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamHack) Stockholm *StarCraft II* tournament*.*[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-:1-3)

### Hearthstone

In *Hearthstone*, Forsen won his first tournament in the May 2015 HTC Invitational,[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-7) and won a Play it Cool streaming marathon in October 2015, achieving the highest rank among the competitors after 24 hours of play.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-8) In 2015, Forsen was one of the top four [*Hearthstone*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearthstone) streamers, streaming to up to 45,000 viewers on his [live stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_streaming) on Twitch.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-:3-9) He was once known as one of the game's most skilled experts at the Miracle Rogue deck, having piloted it to achieve the highest rank in the game's [ladder system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_tournament) on both the North American and European servers in June 2014.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-:0-10)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-11)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-:4-12) In 2017, after spending much of his *Hearthstone* career as a free agent, Forsen signed with American [esports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports) organization [Cloud9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud9) as a streamer.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-:4-12)

## Streaming career

Forsen's stream has been lauded as ""genuinely... fun and entertaining"" for its tightly-knit community and inside jokes, as well as for Forsen's tendency to stream ""[Lidl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidl)"" games, a term coined by Forsen to describes games of low production value.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-13)

In February 2018, Forsen captained his four-player team to first place in a $100,000 [Twitch Rivals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Rivals) [*PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayerUnknown%27s_Battlegrounds) (PUBG) Invitational tournament, winning $13,600.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-14)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-15) The following month, he also participated in the [*Darwin Project*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Project) Invitational tournament, taking first place and winning US$20,000.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-16) In December 2018, he achieved a personal all-time high viewer count of 80,860.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-17)

In late 2020, Forsen began a friendly rivalry with fellow streamer [xQc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQc), the pair competing to achieve the fastest time in a [speedrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrun) of [*Minecraft*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft).[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-18) As of April 2021, Forsen has a personal best of 20:38, seven seconds faster than the 20:45 best time of xQc.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-19)

On 26 November 2020, Forsen received an indefinite suspension from Twitch after he accidentally showed a [GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) sent to him by a viewer displaying a sexually explicit interaction between a woman and a horse on stream. He was unbanned after a month.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-20)

## Community

Forsen's stream community, known as the ""Forsen Boys"" or ""Forsen [Bajs](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bajs)"", has gained notoriety of its own through its practice of [stream sniping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_live_streaming#Risks), especially in games like *PUBG*.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-:2-4) Stream snipers in Forsen's community are noted for locating Forsen in-game and playing loud music and audio through [voice chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_chat_in_online_gaming), and represent a point of appeal for Forsen's audience.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-21) In 2018, the *Darwin Project* Invitational tournament was disrupted by the infiltration of a match lobby by Samme1g, a stream sniper in Forsen's community.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-22)

The community is also known for its practice of [spamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming), and its resulting popularization of [internet memes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme) and Twitch [emotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emote).[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-:1-3) The spread of notable emotes such as ""MonkaS"" and ""PepeHands"" (images of [Pepe the Frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_the_Frog)) have been attributed to Forsen's community on [Reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit).[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-23) Their references to Ugandan action-comedy film [*Who Killed Captain Alex?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_Captain_Alex%3F) have also helped popularise the [Ugandan Knuckles meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuckles_the_Echidna#Ugandan_Knuckles_meme).[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-24) In January 2018, a warped image of Fors' face (""forsenE"") became the most-used emote on Twitch worldwide.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-:1-3)

Forsen's moderation of the community has been described as ""permissive"" and ""*laissez-faire*"", and in 2015, he distanced himself from their actions and the ""Forsen Boys"" label.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-:2-4)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-:3-9) That year, streamer Katy Coe became the target of sexual harassment from members of Forsen's community, culminating in Forsen banning links to her channel after Coe posted to Reddit denouncing the behavior.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-:3-9) In 2017, Forsen received a 24-hour ban from Twitch after members of his community spammed the [n-word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-word) in the 2017 [Awesome Games Done Quick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awesome_Games_Done_Quick) chat room.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsen#cite_note-:2-4)

*****
&gt; Russia has deployed more than 500 Syrian fighters in Ukraine for primarily non-combatant roles, tasking them generally with safeguarding facilities in Luhansk and Donetsk in the past few months, regional intelligence sources told Middle East Eye.

&gt; A Syrian government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told MEE that Russia had recruited the Syrians, including former rebels, through its special forces and the notorious Wagner Group private military contractor, and transferred them to Ukraine.

&gt; The New York Times reported earlier this year that at least 300 Syrian fighters had been sent to Russia for further training, before being deployed in Ukraine.

&gt; The Syrian government official told MEE that about 1,000 Syrian fighters were flown to Russia for the training, but only half of them had gone to Ukraine.

&gt; The Syrian government official said the number of Syrian fatalities was much higher than reported, with at least 50 killed in the Ukrainian bombardment so far.

&gt; &amp;quot;The Syrians aren&amp;#039;t partaking in the actual fighting, they are mainly functioning as logistics near the front lines. However, there is a small number of them that work as part of the artillery,&amp;quot; the official told MEE. Russia has previously deployed Syrian fighters in Libya during the 2019-2020 Libyan conflict, where they fought as part of the Wagner Group on behalf of eastern commander Khalifa Haftar.

&amp;#x200B;

 **La ministre centrafricaine des Affaires étrangères vient d’écrire à son homologue française une lettre dans laquelle elle lui annonce que son pays met fin au décanat accordé au Haut représentant de la France auprès du chef de l’État centrafricain. Un statut qui a toujours fait de l’ambassadeur de France en RCA le doyen du corps diplomatique accrédité à Bangui en vertu d’un accord de coopération entre les deux pays.** 

[ Faustin-Archange Touadéra, le président centrafricain, salue le président français Emmanuel Macron, lors d'une visite à Paris en 2017 ](https://preview.redd.it/4f1oge8euwy91.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cdbbea8d41d04dbeea32e483bb9c48ab662398b)

 C'est un nouveau signe que les relations entre Bangui et Paris se sont fortement dégradés. Une lettre de la ministre centrafricaine des Affaires étrangères, Sylvie Baïpo-Témon, à sa collègue française, Catherine Colonna a fuité mardi 8 novembre.

Il a fallu que la diplomatie centrafricaine s’y prenne à deux fois avant d’envoyer la bonne correspondance à la ministre française des Affaires étrangères. Une première version, bourrée de fautes et qui avait fuité sur les réseaux sociaux, a été annulée et remplacée par un nouveau document qui est arrivé à destination ce mardi 8 novembre, selon une source centrafricaine.

## « La personnalité de l’ambassadeur en cause »

Dans le document, elle s’en prend à l’actuel ambassadeur de France dans des termes particulièrement violents. Le style n’a rien de diplomatique. Elle accuse dans sa lettre l’ambassadeur de France d’avoir « *des attitudes irrespectueuses aux invitations du chef de l’État* », ou encore de s’adonner à « *la désinformation et à la délation* ». La France est accusée de ne pas avoir appliqué « *la réciprocité* » de rigueur en matière diplomatique. La même source centrafricaine enfonce le clou : « *Ce* *n’est pas une escalade dans les relations avec la France, mais c’est la personnalité même de l’ambassadeur qui est en cause* ».

La cheffe de la diplomatie centrafricaine, [**Sylvie Baïpo-Temon**](https://www.rfi.fr/fr/afrique/20220421-centrafrique-la-cheffe-de-la-diplomatie-interpell%C3%A9e-%C3%A0-l-assembl%C3%A9e-sur-les-relations-avec-la-france), annonce à son homologue français que son pays met fin « *au privilège totalement symbolique dont jouissait l’ambassadeur de France depuis le jour de l’indépendance de ce pays, le 13 août 1960, d’être le doyen du corps diplomatique* ».

C’est une escalade de plus entre Paris et Bangui. Les relations entre les deux pays sont au plus mal depuis que le président Faustin-Archange Touadéra a fait appel aux [**paramilitaires russes de Wagner**](https://www.rfi.fr/fr/afrique/20220206-en-centrafrique-les-mercenaires-de-wagner-ne-se-font-pas-que-des-amis). Il y a au sein du pouvoir centrafricain, un groupe qui veut couper tous les ponts avec la France, avant l’organisation d’un référendum sur son 3e mandat contesté, note un spécialiste. Il y a deux mois, la ministre des Affaires étrangères centrafricaine n’avait pas caché tout le mal qu’elle pensait du diplomate français, dans un entretien à Mediapart.

## Un document « pas destiné à être rendu public »

Un proche de Sylvie Baïpo-Témon a toutefois tenté de quelque peu calmer le jeu en expliquant qu’il s’agit d’« *un dysfonctionnement* ». « *Ce document n’était pas destiné à être rendu public* ». Il aurait fuité par la faute d’un diplomate centrafricain qualifié de « *peu professionnel* ».

En réalité, l’ambassadeur de France, Jean-Marc Grosgurin, n’a fait que se conformer aux nouvelles instructions de sa hiérarchie. Elles lui demandent de dénoncer publiquement les fausses informations et autres menaces en provenance des organisations proches du pouvoir. « *De quoi agacer énormément Bangui* », analyse un spécialiste de ce pays. De ce fait, même s’il n’a pas voulu réagir officiellement à cette charge, l’ambassadeur français, s’est fendu d’un tweet mardi matin, dénonçant « *les manipulations stériles, grotesques et mensongères diffusées ad nauseam* ». Un message qui ne laisse pratiquement pas de doute sur son destinataire.

Une source française estime que derrière cette version officielle, il y aurait une volonté de pousser l’ambassadeur de France hors du pays, avant l’organisation éventuelle d’un [**référendum sur un 3e mandat contesté**](https://www.rfi.fr/fr/afrique/20220921-rca-la-perspective-de-la-nouvelle-constitution-suscite-de-vives-protestations-de-l-opposition) du président Faustin-Archange Touadéra.",https://www.reddit.com/r/francophonie/comments/yqg6n0/république_centrafricaine_la_centrafrique_met_fin/,,"La Centrafrique, France",0

##ISW
[Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, November 8](https://www.iswresearch.org/2022/11/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment_8.html )  
Iranian sources announced—without Russian confirmation—that Russian National Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev arrived in Tehran on November 8, likely to discuss the potential sale of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia. Iran likely announced Patrushev’s arrival to highlight the deepening cooperation between Moscow and Tehran to an international audience, as well as to implicitly highlight that a high-ranking Russian official turned to Iran for help in Ukraine.  
Wagner Group forces are continuing to exaggerate their claimed territorial gains in Donbas to further distinguish themselves from proxy and conventional Russian forces.  
Ukrainian forces likely made marginal gains northwest of Svatove, Luhansk Oblast, and Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces intensified offensive operations toward Kreminna.  
Russian forces continued offensive operations around Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and in western Donetsk Oblast.  
Ukrainian authorities attempted to counteract Russian authorities’ continued efforts to strengthen control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).  
The disproportionate financial burden of Russian force generation efforts continues to fall primarily on Russian regional governments’ budgets, prompting public backlash.  
Financial and bureaucratic issues are continuing to hinder Russian efforts to replenish formerly elite units defending critical areas of the front line, potentially threatening the integrity of Russian defenses in occupied parts of Ukraine.  
Russian occupation authorities in Kherson Oblast may be trying to force residents out of the western part of the oblast by cutting communications on the west bank of the Dnipro River.

&gt; At least 21 Russian conscripts are currently being held captive in the Donetsk region after refusing to fight in the war in Ukraine, according to a report.

&gt; The conscripts are not being told why they are held captive in a basement in the village of Zavitne Bazhannia, independent news website Meduza reported, citing a letter from the wives and mothers of detained servicemen obtained by the Russian media project The Insider.

&gt; This is not the first time the Russian army has been accused of holding soldiers captive for refusing to fight in the war.

&gt; In July, dozens, possibly even hundreds of Russian troops who refused to continue fighting and indicated plans to leave the army were held captive in Luhansk Oblast, Meduza reported, citing journalists.

&gt; Russian troops who were held captive in July reportedly said that they were guarded by mercenaries from the infamous Wagner group and were left &amp;quot;Without food&amp;quot; and belongings during their captivity.

&gt; The Russian army has lost 77,170 soldiers since the invasion began in February, including 710 deaths over the past day, as per estimates from the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

🪖 Ukraine is moving again in Kherson.  russian sources are claiming that Ukraine has advanced in the Kherson area, advancing [2km past Dudchany](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1590124851016015872).  Ukraine also established a [foothold in the northern part of Snihurivka](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1590092525632913409) where earlier in the day, Ukraine [destroyed a column](https://twitter.com/mhmck/status/1590112606391775232) of russian military equipment.  Ukrainians also [gained a foothold in Novopetrivka](https://twitter.com/NOELreports/status/1590105496920686592) to the west of Snihurivka.  Telegram posters speak of “[melting front lines](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1590090395152629761)”.

🪖 710 russians were [demobilized](https://twitter.com/golub/status/1589879325599453184) on Tuesday.  In the Svatove there is a report that [200 russians have deserted](https://twitter.com/fuckig_idiot/status/1589951919270731778) their posts.

🪖 Ukraine is currently fighting in the [last line of towns](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1590055370659360768) before [Svatove](https://twitter.com/Flash_news_ua/status/1589898622061400066).  This is an important town in the Luhansk area and once Ukraine controls that, russian defense of Kreminna and Lysychansk become — improbable.

🥷 In occupied Melitopol two collaborators, one of which was the police-chief, [disappeared](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ypaj0h/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/iviz2ro/).

🥷 In occupied Voznesenka, near Melitopol, a church housing russian troops [mysteriously burned down](https://twitter.com/ericfranckx/status/1590122653066485761) in a presumed smoking or smiting incident

🥷 There was an [interesting fire](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1589907703056715776) in Astrakhan, russia.  It probably wasn’t a drone ship, but there’s a non-zero chance it was.

👉 russia is [advancing 3cm a day](https://twitter.com/francis_scarr/status/1589975597769687042) (Thats about 1” in freedom units), but the source is russian so likely it’s -3cm . 

👉 The [💭 exhumation at the mass burial site](https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1589920837775560707) in the Izyum forrest has been completed.  447 bodies were exhumed, 215 women, 194 men, 5 children, 22 Ukrainian soldiers.  30 had marks of severe torture.

👉 While russia is trying to convince the world Ukraine is full of witches and satanists, russia’s battle clerics are teaching the mobilized how to [cast spells on their bullets](https://twitter.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1589980055421296645) so they don’t hit milk or air.  Some [manhole covers on the tanks](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1589966335047794688) might help right?

👉 In Mariupol, russia begins to deploy their “[dragon teeth](https://twitter.com/Tendar/status/1589927568224194560)” [cope pyramids](https://twitter.com/noclador/status/1589954904143327232)  as they try to hold onto the occupied territory.  russia is creating a [multi-layer defense](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1590031879495122945.html) along the eastern bank of the Dnipro river similar to Nazi Germany’s “Atlantic Wall”.  For the first time, russia has shipped military gear through [Mariupol’s port](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1589980296640069632.html). And rounding out Mariupol’s news, russia has [destroyed a mural in Mariupol](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1590006470346932226) which depicted a girl who was a victim of russian shelling in 2015.

👉 Some unfortunate mobilized russians are being [sent to fight with prisoners in the Wagner mercenary group](https://twitter.com/meduza_en/status/1590016880093564928).  Also in russia, a cook on the ill-fated Moskva [was issued mobilization papers](https://twitter.com/shashj/status/1590091245761593344).  russia has declared the man missing, but not deceased (one of the many ways putin avoids payouts and buries casualty figures).

👉 A replacement span for the Kerch Strait bridge is being [moved into position](https://twitter.com/OAlexanderDK/status/1590037542317215745). 

📰 [Happy birthday](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1590001190108295169.html) to the Kyiv Independent!

✊🌻 Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by [western government reports](https://twitter.com/defencehq/status/1553040194680623104) and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.   Currently russia’s goal is to capture the Donetsk Oblast and retain control of the Luhansk Oblast, both tasks it is currently failing.  russia has been [downgrading its stated objectives](https://twitter.com/WarintheFuture/status/1547375127272235010) since its retreat from Kyiv.

🇺🇦 Current state of the war: russia has ~25k troops trapped between Ukrainian forces and the Dnipro river in Kherson to the south.  Ukraine has also mounted a successful [counter-offensive in Kharkiv](https://twitter.com/bradyafr/status/1569140110402244608) that has seen russian forces [driven from the region](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1569243133925367809) and now threatens months of painful russian advances in the Donbas area.  russia has been unable to mount any serious offensive operations since July.  Currently the advantage rests decisively with Ukraine.

*****
&gt; Russia&amp;#039;s invasion of Ukraine put it on an &amp;quot;Irreversible&amp;quot; path toward a clash with the &amp;quot;Collective West&amp;quot;, France has warned.

&gt; &amp;quot;Without having disappeared, this strategy is now coupled with a desire to engage in direct military confrontation, materialised in the war of aggression unleashed against Ukraine,&amp;quot; the French threat assessment said.

&gt; It was signed off by French president Emmanuel Macron, who also warned of heightened tension with Russia in a speech the same day.

&gt; The French president also formally announced the end of the largest French military operation in Africa on Wednesday, under Russian pressure.

&gt; The anti-jihadist Operation Barkhane in Mali, which had 5,500 French soldiers in its heyday, was being wound down in favour of a constellation of smaller forces in neighbouring countries in future, Macron said in Toulon, while standing on a French warship.

&gt; Burkhane&amp;#039;s principal host, turned against France and the West following a putsch in 2021 and signed a contract with Russian mercenary group Wagner to fight rebels instead. Wagner&amp;#039;s presence in Africa caused predation of economic resources, human rights atrocities, and political instability, the French review said.

Not sure if you’ve heard, but the U.S. midterm elections are tomorrow.  


Just kidding, of course. Not sure anyone can think of much else.  


Remember, though, this election is full of wild cards. Traditionally—but not always—the party of the president does poorly in the first midterm election. But we are in uncharted territory: never before in our history have more than half of Americans lost the recognition of a constitutional right, as the Supreme Court took from us with the *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health* decision in June, overturning the 1973 *Roe v. Wade* decision that recognized the constitutional right to an abortion.  


Never, too, have we had to vote in an election where more than half the candidates of one of the parties deny that the president was fairly elected. Those candidates have suggested that, had they been in power in 2020, they would have put former president Donald Trump in power even though he lost the popular vote by more than 7 million and lost in the Electoral College. Their position is a profound attack on our democracy.  


For all the polls showing that Democrats are going to win in huge numbers or Republicans are, no one knows how it will turn out. The polls are deeply problematic this time around, and at least some of them are attempts by Republicans to boost the hopes of their donors and to keep Democrats from voting. Perhaps even more than most elections, this one will come down to turnout.  


There are, though, some stories worth following:  


There has been a crazy amount of money invested in this year’s contests, much of it by a very few people. Ronald Lauder, for example, the 78-year-old heir to the cosmetics fortune, has dumped at least $11 million into getting a Trump Republican, Representative Lee Zeldin, elected governor of New York. Billionaire Peter Thiel put $30 million into super PACs backing Republican senate candidates J.D. Vance in Ohio and Blake Masters in Arizona.  


Today, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian oligarch and the leader of the private military company the Wagner Group, who is close to Russian president Vladimir Putin, boasted that Russians had interfered in U.S. elections and continue to do so. “We have interfered, we are interfering and we will continue to interfere. Carefully, accurately, surgically and in our own way, as we know how to do.” He added: “During our pinpoint operations, we will remove both kidneys and the liver at once.”  


Prigozhin is apparently behind the Russia-based “troll farms” that try to affect U.S. elections. Steven Lee Myers of the *New York Times* writes that Russians have indeed targeted the 2022 elections to make right-wing voters angry and undermine trust in U.S. elections. Their hope is to erode support for Ukraine’s struggle to repel Russian invasion by electing Republicans who side with Putin.  


Republicans are not acting as if they expect big wins tomorrow. Many of the Republican candidates have refused to say they would accept the election results, and Fox News Channel personality Tucker Carlson is already saying that Democrats will steal the election.  


Others are fighting to get Democratic mail-in ballots thrown out, especially in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.  


Still others are trying to game the vote count already, claiming that results that are not announced by the end of the day on Tuesday are suspicious. But votes postmarked on Election Day can take days to arrive. In addition, a number of Republican-dominated states have made it illegal to count mail-in votes before Election Day, creating backlogs that take time to work through. It sounds as if they, like Trump in 2020, are expecting to lose the actual vote and to fight to steal it.  


The Department of Justice will be monitoring the polls in 64 jurisdictions in 24 states to make sure those jurisdictions comply with federal voting rights laws. Officials remind voters that any disruptions at polling places should be reported to officials. Michigan secretary of state Jocelyn Benson expressed thanks to the Department of Justice for “real support for protecting voters,” which she said was missing in 2020 under the former president.  


Aside from tomorrow’s election, there is an epic fight brewing in the Republican Party. Former president Donald Trump threatened to announce tonight at a rally in Ohio that he is running for president in 2024, likely because he believes such an announcement will make it harder for the Department of Justice to indict him for his theft of classified documents when he left the White House. He is also concerned that Florida governor Ron DeSantis will steal his thunder and capture the 2024 nomination, but because they are competing for the same voters, an announcement from Trump will undercut DeSantis.  


Republican Party leaders urged Trump to hold off on the announcement, worrying it would energize Democratic voters before Election Day. In the end, Trump’s announcement tonight was: “I’m going to be making a very big announcement on Tuesday, November 15, at Mar-a-Lago in Florida…. We want nothing to detract from the importance of tomorrow.”  


Finally, for all the uncertainty surrounding tomorrow's election, there is one thing of which I am 100% certain. Far more Americans today are concerned about our democracy, and determined to reclaim it, than were even paying attention to it in 2016. There are new organizations, new connections, new voters, new efforts to remake the country better than it has ever been, and the frantic efforts of the Republicans to suppress voting, gerrymander the country, and now to take away our right to choose our leaders indicates we are far more powerful than we believe we are. No matter what happens tomorrow, that will continue to be true, and I am ever so proud to be one of you.

t3_ysh2vp,29:56.0,lftmensch,gradadmissions,Looking for left/progressive politics + community organizing in public policy schools,"This post may work better in r/PublicPolicy or r/GradSchool but thought I'd start here. 

I am a community organizer who has been working in public art, electoral campaigns, and local organizing for about 5 years since graduating from undergrad. My academic interests are (broadly) in abolition and grassroots organizing, reparatory justice, and social movement culture. I received a scholarship when I was an undergrad that is earmarked for graduate study, and I haven't used it yet because I haven't felt confident enough in my grad school plan and choices to make the leap into a program. 

I can use the scholarship toward any program, but it pays off most via public policy grad programs: a number of MPA/MPP programs at some of the big schools I list out below (Kennedy, Maxwell, Princeton, etc.) have matching awards for this scholarship that make it free or nearly free. 

I know my interests do not fit squarely into a public policy curriculum, and I have long thought that the value of an MPP/MPA degree isn't really worth it or necessary for me if I want to grow as an organizer. But I do have a number of topics I want to research, mig and if it's free or heavily subsidized (which it would be for me) I would really enjoy being back in a public service / policy-focused academic community for a bit.

So, I'm looking for some advice from this group: **if** **you've been in and around public policy grad programs, where have you encountered schools with stronger left/progressive cultures, faculty, and resources?** Most public policy curricula seem to be highly quantitative or have faculty that's fairly conservative. I have a friend at SIPA who calls some of her public policy classmates ""future fascists."" Amongst this collection of schools – Sanford @ Duke, McCourt + Walsh @ Georgetown, Kennedy @ Harvard, Harris @ UChicago, Wagner @ NYU, Watson @ Brown, SPIA @ Princeton, SIPA @ Columbia, Maxwell @ Syracuse, Jackson School/Program @ Yale, Public Policy @ Arizona State, Evans @ the University of Washington – has anyone encountered strong resources or focuses in community organizing or a particularly progressive faculty? What about strong student orgs who are working on grassroots or community-based organizing or social justice projects? 

I'm looking for advice about left/progressive culture within \*public policy grad school\*, but if you know of a program that's not public policy and would fit well with my interests, I'd love to hear about it. 

Thanks y'all :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ysh2vp/looking_for_leftprogressive_politics_community/,,,1

The Russian withdrawal will take some time to complete, and fighting will continue throughout Kherson Oblast as Ukrainian troops advance and come up against pre-prepared Russian defensive lines, especially around Kherson City.  
ISW does not assess the fighting in Ukraine will halt or enter a stalemate due to winter weather, despite faulty Western assumptions.  
Ukraine holds the initiative and is in the process of securing a major victory in Kherson. A ceasefire would provide the Kremlin with the pause it desperately needs to reconstitute Russian forces.

*Mozambique Crisis*

On December 2nd, 1908, a crisis off the coast of Portuguese Mozambique began. 8 American Vessels, who had recently left New Zion, Madagascar, headed towards Oman and Persia, were boarded by Portuguese navymen, with the Americans detained. Over the past 2 years prior, tensions between the Americans on Madagascar and the Portuguese in Mozambique had been rising, due to Portuguese claims of illegal American fishing in their waters. In the build up to the crisis, 4 American Civilian Vessels had been seized by Portugal. By the time negotiations began, President Debs had taken control.

A first initial wave of negotiations proved fruitless, with Portuguese diplomats storming out of the negotiation proceedings due to requests made by the American diplomatic force. However, a second round of negotiations was conducted, with replaced negotiators. Portugal eventually conceded, accepting American reparations and officially defining the maritime border between the two powers.

*Blythe V. Georgia (1910) and the Southern Crisis*

45 years prior, in 1865, the now infamous protester and politician Robert Whitney Blythe was arrested for violating Georgia segregation laws. This began the case *Blythe V. Georgia (1865),* which would go on to define segregationist policies for the remainder of the 19th century. However, in 1910, another member of the Blythe family rose to challenge Georgia Segregation laws. Calhoun Blythe, the grandson of Robert, purposefully entered the ""Whites-Only"" section of the same restaurant his grandfather was arrested in in 1865. Blythe's intention was to complete the goal Robert had set out, and rid the south of Segregation.

After his arrest, a team of Lawyers was assembled to challenge the verdict and pursue the case up to the level of the Supreme Court. Blythe, charged with violating the Separate Dining Act, argued this act was unconstitutional and violated the 7th Amendment.

In a groundbreaking turn of events, the Supreme Court, led by conservative Chief Justice James McReynolds, sided with Blythe, and ruled that the states had no right to force businesses or private establishments to segregate, but neither to integrate.

[The ruling on Blythe V. Georgia (1910) is available to read here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10POW2MOjZrWZrmR8jVVSaqFR7WmEmx3YVO-Vg4eLGXs/edit?usp=sharing)

Upon the declaration of the results, the notorious anti-black terrorist group known as the Ku Klux Klan began terrorizing black communities across the south, lighting mass fires in majority-black neighborhoods and conducting lynchings. In a move highly criticized by many, President Debs ordered of full martial law in the cities of Houston, Birmingham, New Orleans, Memphis, Atlanta, and neighboring counties and cut off all federal funding to the states of Mississippi and Alabama for over a year, as both states had Governors who were members of the aforementioned group. These orders, however, only increased tensions, as ordinary citizens affected by the impounding of federal funding began to riot as well. The Governor of Mississippi has been forced to resign, with the Governor of Alabama rallying further support using Debs' actions in his favor. As of Election Day, protests in the South are still ongoing over the President, with many southerners unfortunately falling victim to joining radical supremacist groups as a result of mass propaganda.

*Riots at Pennsylvania Liberal Party HQ*

In 1911, members of the Pennsylvania Union Party began

\[CONTINUE HERE TOMORROW. BAILEY + SHUTDOWN + THEODORE K + NOTABLE LEGISLATION\]

*The Candidates*

**William Jennings Bryan** is a 52-year-old US Senator from Omaha, and Liberal nominee for the Presidency. Bryan had previously ran for the office of President in 1896, 1897, and 1904, making this his fourth bid for the Presidency. As a founder of the new Liberal Party, Bryan runs on a platform of Free Silver, a Federal Trade Commision, Low Tariffs, Farmer Assistance, a reformed Health Department, and “international peace”. Bryan narrowly won the newly-reformed Liberal Party’s nomination for President, following scandals involving the previous nominee, Governor Joseph Bailey. His running mate is Samuel Bush, a US Senator from Connecticut. He has been criticised for his apparent “flip-flop”, initially working in Congress as a Labour Party activist before becoming a Dissident.

\[IMAGE OF BRYAN\]\[IMAGE OF BUSH\]

**Eugene Debs** is the 57-year-old incumbent President of the United States, and Democratic-Labour Nominee for the Presidency. The First Debs Administration has been rather controversial, with many hailing his political achievements, and many criticising his response to the situation in the South (more details above) and the Portugal Crisis (more details above). He runs on much the same platform as before, supporting relief for the unemployed, press freedom, and the public ownership of the transportation and communication industries, a move which has been criticised and labelled as the main driving force behind market instability, specifically in the transportation industry. His running mate is Senator John McCarthy, a US Senator from Hochunk who previously ran against Debs as the Vice Presidential Candidate of William Howard Taft, who Debs faced in 1908. McCarthy joined the Union Party in 1910, and helped rebrand the party as the Democratic-Labour Party.

**Theodore Johnson** is the 31-year-old incumbent Governor of Mississippi, who only narrowly qualifies for President at just 1 year older than the minimum required age. Johnson runs as the candidate of the National Reformist party, a recently formed party that advocates for economic interventionism, the breaking up of monopolies, a progressive tax system, environmental regulation, the McCarthist “New Nationalism” ideology, which advocates for the removal of special interests, a gradual income tax, regulations on child labour, and government supervision of large businesses. Johnson, as Governor, has been incredibly unpopular in the South, however remains popular among the industrialist north. Johnson only won the title of Governor after the previous Governor was forced to resign due to President Debs cutting off all federal funding to the state as a result of the Governor’s membership in the KKK. Johnson has been criticised as “shoving” his agenda down the throat of Mississippi, a state which is still recovering from the Southern Crisis. His running mate is Henry Ford, a businessman and industrialist who serves as Attorney General of the United States. Ford has been criticised as an “out of place” running mate, due to his business and industrialist practices in the past.

Ukrainian troops have made major territorial gains throughout Kherson Oblast on November 11 and will continue consolidating control of the western bank in the coming days.  
Russian milbloggers criticized the Russian MoD’s statements about the Russian withdrawal to the left bank but generally took a more muted attitude to Ukrainian gains.  
Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations towards Kreminna and Svatove, Luhansk Oblast, and Ukrainian forces targeted Russian logistics in rear Luhansk Oblast.  
Russian forces continued ground assaults around Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Vuhledar.  
Ukrainian forces continued to target Russian force concentrations in Zaporizhia Oblast.  
Wagner Group financer Yevgeny Prigozhin continued to form parallel military structures in Belgorod and Kursk oblasts, even though there is no threat of a Ukrainian ground invasion into Russian territory.  
The Russian Ministry of Defense’s (MoD) subpar conduct of partial mobilization continues to generate social tension.  
Ukrainian partisans continued to target Russian occupation authorities.

&gt; A Russian prisoner turned mercenary was brutally killed while trying to desert by Kremlin-linked Wagner troops, who filmed the encounter to impress their boss nicknamed &amp;quot;Putin&amp;#039;s chef&amp;quot;.

&gt; &amp;quot;It seems to me that this film should be called: &amp;#039;A dog dies a dog&amp;#039;s death,&amp;#039;&amp;quot; said Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is the financier of Wagner Group and is considered a close ally of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president.

&gt; In return for fighting for Wagner Group in Ukraine, Russian officials have promised them pardons for the crimes they have committed.

&gt; Reports said that he had been traded back to the Russian side in a prisoner exchange before he was killed by Wagner Group mercenaries.

&gt; Wagner Group has previously said that anybody who deserts in Ukraine will be killed.

&gt; Some analysts have said that the emergence of Wagner Group as an important auxiliary force to the Russian army since its invasion of Ukraine suggests that Mr Prigozhin, himself a convicted criminal, covets a more senior role inside the Kremlin.

t3_yu7b1c,57:57.0,FallujahVet,DEFCON100,"Morning Dispatch, 13 November 2022: Brutality doesn't win wars - honoring the Geneva Conventions wins wars.","Welcome new members! 14 Eagle Dancers dancing the Eagle Dance. There are no blue check marks here, but if you have found this corner of the internet then you are plugged in to USA national security decision-making at the highest echelon, and your input is hereby respectfully solicited.

Made it through another Veterans' Day, but barely. I couldn't bring myself to listen to SECDEF or VP Harris speak; it is all so much empty meaningless noise from an ungrateful nation of spoiled selfish cowards who shit on the warriors that fought for them; a dishonorable nation that tortures its own warriors with homelessness. I won't bullshit you, I won't lie and say everything is great and America ""supports the troops"" when you do not, for self-deception causes nations to lose wars as Russia is losing now. I regret going to war for you, and if I could do it all over again I wouldn't - it's that bad, you are that bad, America is awful towards veterans, and we must stop deceiving ourselves like Russia does. The fucking VA is embezzling from veterans, for fuck's sake! May God destroy those thieves.

""Being accused of brutality in war is like being fined for speeding in a car race."" This is what Prigozhin's Wagner Group ""Grey Zone"" Telegram channel has to say about their recent on-camera sledgehammer execution of a defector. This statement reveals that Prigozhin has less than a child's understanding of war. He is an idiot. Apparently it has not yet occurred to Russia that by wanton brutality an army may lose a war and defeat itself, as we USA defeated ourselves in Iraq and Afghanistan by committing war crimes under fucking idiot war criminal baby boomer commanders.

After Putin, Prigozhin will be one of the contenders for the throne. There will be a massive civil war clash between Prigozhin's Wagner Group and the regular Russian military. Prigozhin would be awful to the Russian People, maybe worse than Putin; and yet, his dilettantish car-racing analogy makes me think he would be even less of a threat to us on the battlefield than Putin is. And Putin is a paper tiger.

One of the main factors that contributed to Ukraine's world-shocking victory over Russia is their humane, dignified, respectful treatment of prisoners-of-war. At the outset of hostilities I begged Ukraine to follow the Geneva Conventions, to not defeat themselves with war crimes as we did. Ukraine has done an outstanding job. And look at the fruit of this strategy: Russian soldiers surrender in droves, they hand over their tanks to bolster the Ukrainian Army, they spill valuable intelligence over a cup of hot tea and a cigarette, no torture needed. Brutality doesn't win wars, Prigozhin, you dumb fucking merc - Ukraine's strategy of following the Geneva Conventions wins wars.

I will apply the distant gut-destroyer qi technique to Putin, Prigozhin, and Kadyrov again soon. They are all valid military targets, and on top of that they are all commanders. Another repetition. Department of Defense, you should fucking pay me for my years of hard work and active duty service in defense of our country from 20 February 2018 to present.

*Cabinet Troubles*

Following the inauguration of President Debs, the majority coalition in the Senate, lead by Senate Majority Leader Aurelius Shaft, a Liberal-American, refused to confirm any Cabinet appointees from President Debs. For roughly a year, President Debs had no concrete cabinet, limiting the President’s abilities to respond to the crises of 1910 and 1910. The majority of the above mentioned Cabinet members served as Acting Ministers for the first year of their term.

*Mozambique Crisis*

On December 2nd, 1908, a crisis off the coast of Portuguese Mozambique began. 8 American Vessels, who had recently left New Zion, Madagascar, headed towards Oman and Persia, were boarded by Portuguese navymen, with the Americans detained. Over the past 2 years prior, tensions between the Americans on Madagascar and the Portuguese in Mozambique had been rising, due to Portuguese claims of illegal American fishing in their waters. In the build up to the crisis, 4 American Civilian Vessels had been seized by Portugal. By the time negotiations began, President Debs had taken control.

A first initial wave of negotiations proved fruitless, with Portuguese diplomats storming out of the negotiation proceedings due to requests made by the American diplomatic force. However, a second round of negotiations was conducted, with replaced negotiators. Portugal eventually conceded, accepting American reparations and officially defining the maritime border between the two powers.

*C. Blythe V. Georgia (1910) and the Southern Crisis*

45 years prior, in 1865, the now infamous protester and politician Robert Whitney Blythe was arrested for violating Georgia segregation laws. This began the case *Blythe V. Georgia (1865)*, which would go on to define segregationist policies for the remainder of the 19th century. However, in 1910, another member of the Blythe family rose to challenge Georgia Segregation laws. Calhoun Blythe, the grandson of Robert, purposefully entered the ""Whites-Only"" section of the same restaurant his grandfather was arrested in in 1865. Blythe's intention was to complete the goal Robert had set out, and rid the south of Segregation.

After his arrest, a team of attorneys was assembled to challenge the verdict and pursue the case up to the level of the Supreme Court. Blythe, charged with violating the Separate Dining Act, argued this act was unconstitutional and violated the 7th Amendment.

In a groundbreaking turn of events, the Supreme Court, led by conservative Chief Justice James McReynolds, sided with Blythe, and ruled that the states had no right to force businesses or private establishments to segregate, but neither to integrate.

\[The ruling on C. Blythe V. Georgia (1910) is available to read here\](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10POW2MOjZrWZrmR8jVVSaqFR7WmEmx3YVO-Vg4eLGXs/edit?usp=sharing)

[The Seventh Amendment](https://preview.redd.it/n2s8re7wjmz91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d63b7680d9bd5e987d0591ec389700e077723f4)

Upon the declaration of the results, the notorious anti-black terrorist group known as the Ku Klux Klan began terrorizing black communities across the south, lighting mass fires in majority-black neighborhoods and conducting lynchings. In a move highly criticized by many, President Debs ordered of full martial law in the cities of Houston, Birmingham, New Orleans, Memphis, Atlanta, and neighboring counties and cut off all federal funding to the states of Mississippi and Alabama for over a year, as both states had Governors who were members of the aforementioned group. These orders, however, only increased tensions, as ordinary citizens affected by the impounding of federal funding began to riot as well. The Governor of Mississippi has been forced to resign, with the Governor of Alabama rallying further support using Debs' actions in his favor. As of Election Day, protests in the South are still ongoing over the President, with many southerners unfortunately falling victim to joining radical supremacist groups as a result of mass propaganda.

*The Joseph Bailey Controversy*

Provocative Governor Joseph Bailey of Texas, upon the invocation of the President's martial law, declared the legislation ""a waste of damn time"" and ""not worth the paper it's written on."" After much confusion over the interpretation of these remarks, Governor Bailey unilaterally declared the law ""nullified"" in the state of Texas, re-igniting a long-dormant constitutional controversy. 

Washington, already gridlocked, scrambled to coordinate a response to the governor's brazen claims. A lawsuit was quickly brought to the Supreme Court, though by the time Justice Clarence Darrow had issued certiorari, the governor had fired first. Upon his orders, members of the Texas State Guard seized federal buildings in Texas, detained all federal employees - including active-duty soldiers on base in Texas - and had them sent by train to Louisiana. The Supreme Court immediately issued a bench ruling that nullification was a void doctrine by the Supremacy Clause, and the White House followed by preparing military response. 

Backed into a corner, Governor Bailey attempted to lash out, declaring his own martial law and ordering the State Guard to secure the state from ""foreign invasion."" Despite these orders, the Texas State Assembly convened in the Capitol, and began a motion to impeach President Bailey. Due to threats made against the lives of individual legislators and their families, the Impeachment Vote was swayed in favor against Governor Bailey. Upon hearing the news of the vote, Governor Bailey headed to the State Legislature and announced his intent to resign, a move that shocked many Bailey supporters. Bailey was arrested in the Capitol Building, however Bailey’s current location is unknown.

*Death of Vice President MacGilliam*

On September 10th, 1910, George MacGilliam, the incumbent Vice President of the United States, met with notorious socialist terrorist Theodore K. in the desert sands of the US Territory of New Mexico. MacGilliam had used his connections with President Debs, a “socialist”, to get Theodore K’s trust, in hopes of luring the terrorist out to a secluded location and arresting him for his involvement in the organization of the Wall Street Bombing of 1898, which left 19 dead. President Debs had not been informed of MacGilliam’s mission.

Upon arrival, MacGilliam and K. began the discussion of blowing up the home of the incumbent “Grand Wizard” of the above mentioned white supremacist group, the Ku Klux Klan. MacGilliam soon after revealed his true intentions, to which K. responded by drawing his revolver on the Vice President and firing. Several accompanying terrorists soon fired upon and killed the three Agents guarding the Vice President. Further Agents hiding behind a nearby rock, who had been waiting to conduct an arrest of K, began opening fire upon the fleeing posse. 

Theodore K. had been shot while fleeing, with his status unknown as of the 1912 election. Soon after the standoff, Vice President MacGilliam was officially pronounced dead. President Debs has condemned the actions of the terrorist group.

*Governor Johnson Scandal*

Following the actions of President Debs in response to the Southern Crisis, the radical white-supremacist Governor Theodore G. Bilbo was forced to resign in order to resume federal funding to the State. Bilbo’s replacement was Theodore Johnson, a notable Independent politician swept into office during a special election on promises of fixing the Mississippi Economy. Johnson made notable reforms to the state in the fields of education, taxation, and legal representation. 

However, Johnson often conflicted with the State Legislature, still heavily influenced by former Governor Bilbo. After Johnson attempted to pass a new Education act, which would construct a university in Jackson, Mississippi named after the Governor, the State Legislature amended the act to name the University after George W. Grant, the President of the short-lived Confederacy which fought the United States during the civil war. Johnson refused to sign the bill.

Tensions rose between Johnson and the Legislature only heightened after Johnson received the National Reformist nomination for President. The State Legislature was prepared to remove Johnson at any point if he made any mistake. Their preparations turned into reality in 1911, after a reportedly “drunk and mad” Johnson proposed a bill to restrict Ballot Access in Mississippi, eliminating the Liberal and Democratic-Labor candidates from the state ballot. Soon after, Johnson was impeached and removed, with former Governor Bilbo taking office once more. Johnson was also removed from the National Reformist ticket.

*The 6th Cholera Outbreak*

In January of 1911, a returning group of employees under Robert Henderson set sail from Korea back to the United States, unknowingly bringing with them the disease Cholera. On the return journey, four individuals died from the disease, with all but one quarantined by San Francisco dock officials upon arrival. The one in question, one John Esequel, would return home to Lombard street after evading dockyard officials, releasing the plague into the city.

After a successful quarantine, over five thousand, including Esequel, layed dead. However, officials are concerned the disease could have potentially been carried out of the city of San Francisco. The US Government is continuing to evaluating the risk of a nation-wide outbreak as of the 1912 election.

*Notable Legislation passed during the Debs Administration*

* *The Reading and Libraries Act, 1909* \- An act to construct an “aqueduct library” in towns with more than 1,000 citizens and give said library adequate funding. Unfortunately for the Government, the cost of building and funding these new facilities has become unsustainable.
* *Rio Grande Admission Act, 1910* \- An act to admit the Rio Grande Territory as a new state.
* *The Anti-Terror Act, 1911* \- An act to “combat terrorism” in the United States. In the wake of the Southern Crisis (See Above), Congress passed the Anti-Terror Act, which granted the government the right to: 
   * Seize the property of those in “terrorist organizations” such as the white-supremacist Ku Klux Klan and the socialist Red Guard
   * Levy a 500$ fine on those who disenfranchise another.

*The Candidates*

**William Jennings Bryan** is a 52-year-old US Senator from Omaha, and Liberal nominee for the Presidency. Bryan had previously ran for the office of President in 1896, 1897, and 1904, making this his fourth bid for the Presidency. As a founder of the new Liberal Party, Bryan runs on a platform of Free Silver, a Federal Trade Commision, Low Tariffs, Farmer Assistance, a reformed Health Department, and “international peace”. Bryan narrowly won the newly-reformed Liberal Party’s nomination for President, following scandals involving the previous nominee, Governor Joseph Bailey. His running mate is Samuel Bush, a US Senator from Connecticut. He has been criticised for his apparent “flip-flop”, initially working in Congress as a Labor Party activist before becoming a Dissident.

**Eugene Debs** is the 57-year-old incumbent President of the United States, and Democratic-Labor Nominee for the Presidency. The First Debs Administration has been rather controversial, with many hailing his political achievements, and many criticising his response to the situation in the South (more details above) and the Portugal Crisis (more details above). He runs on much the same platform as before, supporting relief for the unemployed, press freedom, and the public ownership of the transportation and communication industries, a move which has been criticised and labelled as the main driving force behind market instability, specifically in the transportation industry. His running mate is Senator John McCarthy, a US Senator from Hochunk who previously ran against Debs as the Vice Presidential Candidate of William Howard Taft, who Debs faced in 1908. McCarthy joined the Union Party in 1910, and helped rebrand the party as the Democratic-Labor Party.

**Henry Ford** is the 49-year-old American industrialist and current Attorney General of the United States, who runs under the banner of the new National Reformist Party. The party supports an Industrialist/Mercantile Economic Policy, Interventionism, free competition, Trust Busting, a Progressive Tax System, environmental-protectionism, and the McCarthyist ideals of *”New Nationalism”*, which is the beliefs that special interests should be removed from politics, corporate and business affairs must be made public, the Government should supervise large corporations, a graduated income tax, limiting work hours, regulations on child labor and female labor, improving overall working conditions, improving the safety standards for products, and common schools for book-based learning. Ford has been criticised for his industrialist practices in the transportation industry, which seem “out of place” for a generally leftist campaign. However, support has risen among the working areas of the Great Lakes. His running mate is Robert Henderson, a businessman from California.

**\*Ford has been heavily impacted by the actions of Theodore Johnson, the former National Reformist nominee for President who was impeached and removed from the office of Governor of Mississippi after passing legislation which directly removed the Liberal and Democratic-Labor parties from the Mississippi ballot for President. (See above “Johnson Scandal”)**

*Other Candidates*

**John D. Rockefeller**, the former President of the United States, who governed from 1877-1885, runs a third party campaign under the “Protect the Business” ticket. To vote for this candidate, comment “I write in John D. Rockefeller”.

t3_yx2rwc,04:23.0,wjbc,chicagobulls,[The Ringer] Seven NBA Observations on the Golden State Warriors’ Window and More. It’s early for trade talk … but not too early. We examine the slow starts in Golden State and Chicago and what their options might be if their struggles continue.,"To me this article puts too much blame on Vucevic and not enough on the Bulls' other starters, but there's no doubt that Vuc is struggling on defense -- and has never been a great defender. It also didn't help that his back up, Drummond, missed six games and was still recovering from a shoulder sprain the last two games. But Drummond's defense is also suspect. 

&gt;3. Will the Chicago Bulls Find an Answer at Center?  
&gt;  
&gt;The Bulls have the sixth-ranked defense, but their starting unit has been shredded when Nikola Vucevic is on the floor. They’re allowing 111.9 points per 100 possessions, about the equivalent of the NBA’s 18th-worst defensive rating. While Vooch isn’t entirely to blame—Lonzo Ball is still sidelined with his knee issue, and both the Bulls’ best players, DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine, aren’t stoppers—he has not elevated his play on defense like, say, Brook Lopez has for years with the Bucks.  
&gt;  
&gt;Second Spectrum says 17 players have defended at least 300 pick-and-rolls this season. No one has hemorrhaged more points per play in that group than Vucevic, at 1.08 points per pick-and-roll. Over the weekend against the Nuggets, Vooch passively closed out against Nikola Jokic pick-and-pops, letting Joker drive to the rim. Last week, Raptors rookie Christian Koloko had open dunks since Vooch was so out of position.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bulls head coach Billy Donovan once infamously said “can’t play Kanter” when the Thunder team he was coaching at the time got shredded with a defensive liability on the floor. Vucevic isn’t nearly as bad as Enes Kanter was for those squads, and Donovan doesn’t have many better answers with Andre Drummond as a reserve, but the Bulls’ bench units have been superior and have helped boost their defensive rating into the top 10. Vooch has not improved on defense despite a diminished offensive role, which is what the Bulls hoped for last year when they acquired Vucevic and Al-Farouq Aminu from the Magic (in a trade that sent Wendell Carter Jr., Otto Porter Jr., and firsts in 2021 \[Franz Wagner\] and 2023 \[top-four protected\] to Orlando). That deal is looking like a terrible choice right now. Carter is already a better center than Vooch. Wagner is one of the league’s most versatile forwards. Porter just won a championship with the Warriors as a pivotal role player. Getting Vooch made some sense at the time for a team looking to make the playoffs, but not all deals pan out.  
&gt;  
&gt;Vucevic can become a free agent in 2023. DeRozan will be one the following year. LaVine is represented by Klutch Sports, an agency that hasn’t held back from getting players out of losing situations even if it gets ugly. The Bulls have a lot of talent, but Vucevic, at age 32, is unable to provide the type of rim protection they need, and can’t take them to where they want to go.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Bulls should be aggressive in seeking an improvement at the center position this season. Chicago native Anthony Davis would be a dream acquisition if the Lakers decided to trade him. Options after that get uninspiring.  
&gt;  
&gt;But does an AD addition even put them on the level of Boston or Milwaukee? Or even a healthy Philly? Or Cleveland? Are the Bulls even better than a Nets or Heat team that figures itself out? Chicago seems like a team stuck in the middle, and right now the franchise is tied for the eighth-best draft lottery odds. The Bulls should consider zagging and joining the Lose-O-Rama for Wembanyama*.* DeRozan or LaVine could aid a number of wannabe-playoff teams like the Lakers and Knicks or should-be contenders like the Warriors and Heat. With Ayo Dosunmu, Patrick Williams, and Coby White, the Bulls have some promising young talent but no one who can steer the future of the franchise. Moving veterans could restock their draft assets, add more youth, and give them a better chance to land a center who happens to be generational.

Ils surviennent plus tôt que prévu et constituent clairement une rupture avec les autorités de Bamako, mais après une série de précédents récents. 

Niagalé Bagayoko, présidente du Réseau africain pour le secteur de la sécurité (ASSN) : « *On a eu une annonce en ce sens de la Suède, une menace de l'Allemagne. Les Égyptiens avaient également momentanément suspendu leur participation. Il est possible que d'autres contingents décident de se retirer.* »

La force française Barkhane a elle-même quitté le Mali cet été. Son retrait a été annoncé en février et s'est achevé en août. Techniquement, les autorités maliennes de transition ne l'ont jamais expulsée, mais elles avaient créé des conditions inacceptables pour Paris, rendant sa présence impossible. Notamment en remettant en cause les accords de défense liant les deux pays, et en recourant à [**des supplétifs russes**](https://www.rfi.fr/fr/afrique/20220110-mali-200-mercenaires-du-groupe-wagner-%C3%A0-s%C3%A9gou-dans-le-nord-est-du-pays) déployés aux côtés des forces nationales. Ces derniers sont qualifiés de mercenaire du groupe Wagner par Paris, ce que Bamako dément.

## Même scénario ?

Ce même schéma est-il en train de se reproduire pour la Minusma et particulièrement pour sa partie militaire ? « *Le Mali a fait connaître ses réserves quant à certains points du mandat, se réservant notamment le droit de ne pas donner accès à certaines des requêtes de la Minusma, notamment concernant les droits de l'homme. Il est assez difficile de savoir dans quelle mesure les autorités souhaitent réellement le maintien de cette force dont elles ont veillé à restreindre les capacités d'intervention* », estime Niagalé Bagayoko.

Le mandat de la Minusma a été renouvelé en juin, pour un an. D'ici janvier 2023, dans moins de deux mois, la mission onusienne a prévu d'élaborer un rapport d'étape qui est censé évaluer sa capacité à se déplacer et à travailler de manière efficace au Mali.

t3_yyubf4,53:07.0,RPwriter727,dirtypenpals,[M4A] Bringing in the Black New World Order,"***(Fair warning to all, this is essentially a raceplay prompt. Just a heads up if that's not your thing.)***  
  
Someday, the world will embrace the truth that black men are superior. A truth that society has tried to deny for so long...but one day it will be undeniable. The time for the Black New World Order isn't quite here yet though. No, it's going to take some work to get there...  
  
There's a group of black men actively making this world come to pass. The secret 'illuminati', the cabal of united black kings and the seduced women in their thrall forcing these changes on society from the shadows, secretly dragging society into the inevitable future: The MansaMusa Corporation and all its subsidiaries.  
  
Onyx Talent Management manages a slew of Insta-thots spamming the timeline with their love and adoration of black men as well as beloved award-winning starlets who passionately speak out against issues facing African-Americans and subtly influence the popular culture to go black.  
  
The MansaMusa Corporation sponsors several black fraternities on white college campuses, mentoring bright young black kings on how to breed as many white sorority girls and get as many white professors to cheat on their limpdick husbands as possible.  
  
With strategy and planning that rivals the CIA, black studs are strategically planted. An undercover MansMusa stud could be any black man. The Midwest town's new pastor. Your handsome coworker. The janitor you never really noticed. Hell, your 'harmless' black friend right next to you could have been a MansaMusa agent the whole time, on a mission to see you **BLACKED**. All your other friends too.  
  
Negus Publishing promotes books with black male romantic leads. The next Twilight, the next Fifty Shades of Grey, is filled with mighty black studs for bored white housewives to fantasize about and lust over.  
  
The Zulu Scientific Research Institute publishes the scientific findings of esteemed white female scientists such as Dr. Wagner. Wagner is developing a secret experimental chemical compound that can give nonblack men a little 'help' taking their proper place. Biologically feminizing them into black cock worshipping sissy sluts...Dr. Wagner's research is controversial but unequivocally proves that a certain race of men is superior to all other races. The good doctor did all her research firsthand of course...  
  
Of course, other scientists object. The MansaMusa Corporation simply sends their black studs to seduce and black the women they love...there aren't many problems that can't be solved by sending in a strategically placed stud. For example, the Commissioner of a local police precinct, the District Attorney, the Mayor and the Governor...they are all willing to crackdown on police brutality. Anything to stop the euphoric cries of their precious wives and daughters...  
  
White women and black men are elected to influential political roles in both major parties. Soon there are whispers of another Obama in the Oval Office...  
  
Yes, under the table and behind closed doors, in secret meetings, unbeknownst to the general public, the MansaMusa Corporation is forcing the culture to change, forcing their righteous agenda and they won't stop until all of western society is **BLACKED**.  
  
Welcome to the future...  
  
(So yeah, that's the gist of it. My kinks are interracial, raceplay, cheating, cuckolding, breeding, incest, group sex, anal, sissification...honestly, the list is pretty lengthy. I don't do scat and snuff, but everything else might be negotiable.  
  
If you're someone who's interested in making this a long-term, detailed RP and use proper grammar, respond in a PM, list any particular kinks you have and we can take it from there. You play the women, I'll play as the black men. If you want to make any changes, we can discuss those too. Can RP here or on Discord, feel free to PM me as long as this is up.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/yyubf4/m4a_bringing_in_the_black_new_world_order/,,,0
t3_ywr7ow,44:35.0,TeeFee173,cologne,Tonight: Cultural exchange meeting “Melting Pot”,"Would you like to meet new people, learn about cultures from all over the world and practice another language? Then 'Melting Pot"" is THE place to go!

Each Wednesday from 7 pm at the bar “die Wohngemeinschaft“, Richard-Wagner-Str. 39, 50674 Köln (near Rudolfplatz).

'Melting Pot' is a sociable and fresh new way to practice another language, make local friends, and discover how colorful Cologne actually is.

• How does it work? You will get different little sticker flags, your native language goes at the top. If you speak more than one, then the rest are sorted by proficiency.

• How much does it cost? There is no entrance fee, but to cover our administrative costs and offer you the best experience we need your help! That's why we have a minimum consumption of 6€.

At 'Melting Pot' there is different history in every corner you find. By celebrating and embracing cultural diversity, we seek to create memorable moments and enable you to be a part of the beauty that is multiculturalism. We believe that speaking different languages and interacting with each other is the best way to get to know the diversity of cultural identities in our city. This is a melting pot where history, experience, and culture unite to form Cologne's unique flavour.

See pictures of our past events in our Facebook group [https://www.facebook.com/groups/melting.pot.cologne](https://www.facebook.com/groups/melting.pot.cologne) or check out our Instagram [https://instagram.com/socialmeltingpot?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=](https://instagram.com/socialmeltingpot?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)",https://www.reddit.com/r/cologne/comments/ywr7ow/tonight_cultural_exchange_meeting_melting_pot/,,"Tonight, Melting Pot",1

&gt; Thousands of international troops are withdrawing from Mali amid surging violence, growing Russian influence and an acute humanitarian crisis.

&gt; The UN Security Council renewed its mandate for the UN peacekeepers in Mali for one year on 29 June, although the Malian government opposed requests to allow freedom of movement for rights investigators with the mission.

&gt; Mali is among several countries targeted in recent years by Russian disinformation and influence operations.

&gt; Mali has been facing recurrent jihadist attacks since 2012, part of a broader surge in violence linked to Islamic militancy across the Sahel region, which has displaced more than 2.5 million people and killed more than 8,000 in 2022, according to ACLED, a monitoring group.

&gt; Most recently, tens of thousands were forced to flee their villages in Mali during apparent systematic attacks by Islamist armed groups aligned with the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara.

&gt; &amp;quot;Islamist armed groups in northeast Mali have carried out terrifying and seemingly coordinated attacks on villages, massacring civilians, looting homes and destroying property,&amp;quot; said Jehanne Henry, senior Africa adviser at Human Rights Watch.

Russian sources and proxy officials are flagrantly touting the forced adoption of Ukrainian children into Russian families.  
Ukrainian sources continued to clarify the damage caused by the massive November 15 Russian missile strike across Ukraine.  
The Russian information space largely followed the official Kremlin framing of the missile strike on Polish territory as a Western provocation.  
Wagner Group financer Yevgeny Prigozhin is continuing to establish himself as a central figure in the pro-war ultranationalist community likely in pursuit of ambitious political goals.  
Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the directions of Svatove and Kreminna.  
Russian forces continued ground attacks near Bakhmut and Avdiivka, and in western Donetsk Oblast.  
Ukrainian forces continued targeting Russian forces and logistics nodes in southern Ukraine.  
Multiple reports indicate that the morale and psychological state of Russian forces in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts are exceedingly low.  
Russian officials continued their efforts to replace proxy officials in occupied territories with Russian officials, forcibly relocate residents, and integrate occupied areas with Russia.

*****
&gt; During the months of September-October, a record-breaking 23,000 inmates of Russian penitentiaries were drafted to serve in the war in Ukraine against the backdrop of recruitment conducted by the Wagner Group.

&gt; According to reports by the Federal Penitentiary Service examined by Mediazona, since the beginning of August, at least 349,000 inmates have been held in penitentiaries.

&gt; The decrease in the number of inmates is taking place against the backdrop of recruitment of convicts by the Wagner Group, founded by Yevgeny Prigozhin , who will then be deployed in Ukraine.

&gt; Prigozhin promises the inmates freedom in exchange for their participation in the war against Ukraine.

&gt; According to her calculations, as of the end of October, the number of inmates recruited by the Wagner Group exceeded 20,000 people and had reached 30,000 by the middle of November.

&gt; Background: The first reports about the recruitment of inmates by the Wagner Group appeared in July.

&gt;""It’s sharing the ball, it’s who we are. When you don’t pass the ball in our program, it’s deflating. Everybody on the floor, on the bench, we all feel it. We had willing passers, we tried to play good to great basketball, but for Mikal to have nine assists, that’s a feat 'cause usually he’s shooting, so tweet that, he’ll get a kick out of that.""

Mikal:

&gt;""Just getting better is what I preach every year. I just try to come in every year and get a little bit better. You don’t improve crazy numbers. Some people do improve by five points, to 20 points, but just knowing you’re going out there and getting better, even if sometimes numbers don’t show it, it’s about the feel.""

&gt;""I’m just working hard, try to get a little better in every category, so just keep going.""

On near triple double

&gt;""Nine, nine, I don’t care. I don’t care if it’s a double double. I want the triple-double or nothing.""

Payne:

On Mikal

&gt;""Mikal said he’s the second-best passer on the team. Nah, he dished that thing today. I think a lot of them (assists) came from me, offensive boards. He did a good job tonight passing the ball. He almost had a triple-double. That’s big time.""

Kerr:

&gt;""The Suns played great defense and that led to great offense. (Suns coach Monty Williams) had them ready and they really executed and played with a lot of force. They deserved to win the game and they made it tough on our guys.""

 **Le Bénin, le Burkina Faso, la Côte d'Ivoire, le Ghana, le Togo, le Mali et le Niger sont réunis à Accra, jeudi et vendredi, afin de discuter de leur coopération en matière de sécurité et de renseignement. Objectif : contrer la propagation des violences jihadistes du Sahel vers les côtes du golfe de Guinée.** 

[ Des soldats gardent un camp militaire à Ouagadougou le 8 octobre 2022, lors des funérailles de 27 militaires tués dans une embuscade d'Al-Qaïda. ](https://preview.redd.it/29l9q9wczp0a1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2f5a05c4152e18733d9db55361bfd1294dcf2cf)

 Sept États d'Afrique de l'Ouest ont entamé jeudi 17 novembre à Accra une réunion en vue d'accroître leur coopération dans la lutte contre la [propagation des violences jihadistes](https://www.france24.com/fr/afrique/20221026-forum-de-dakar-la-souverainet%C3%A9-s%C3%A9curitaire-en-afrique-au-c%C5%93ur-des-d%C3%A9bats) du Sahel vers les côtes du golfe de Guinée.

Cette session de discussions techniques sur la coopération en matière de sécurité et de renseignement doit se poursuivre vendredi. La réunion vise à préparer une réunion ministérielle des pays de l'initiative d'Accra devant se tenir la semaine prochaine, à une date non encore rendue publique.

Lancée en 2017, ce forum implique le Bénin, le Burkina Faso, la Côte d'Ivoire, le Ghana et le Togo. Le Mali et le Niger l'ont rejoint en tant qu'observateurs.

La collaboration est plus que jamais nécessaire car la menace de l'extrémisme violent est ""plus répandue qu'on ne le pensait auparavant et transcende les frontières"", a déclaré jeudi le ministre ghanéen de la sécurité nationale, Albert Kan-Dapaah, notant que ""le paysage de la menace ne cesse de changer"".

Les violences jihadistes au Sahel ont débuté en 2012, au Mali, faisant des milliers de morts et des millions de déplacés, mais elles se sont étendues au Burkina Faso et au Niger voisins et menacent désormais les États du golfe de Guinée.

Le Bénin, la Côte d'Ivoire, le Ghana et le Togo font ainsi face à la menace de combattants du groupe État islamique (EI) et d'Al-Qaïda, implantés au Niger et au Burkina Faso, et qui multiplient désormais les attaques sur leur territoire. Et l'inquiétude grandit quant à de possibles recrutements locaux au sein même de ces pays.

## Sommet le 22 novembre

Les discussions d'Accra doivent également associer des représentants de gouvernements de l'UE, de la Grande-Bretagne, et de la Communauté économique des États d'Afrique de l'Ouest (Cédéao).

Les chefs d'État régionaux discuteront des propositions en matière de sécurité au cours d'un sommet prévu le mardi 22 novembre, selon l'Initiative d'Accra.

La junte militaire au Mali depuis les deux coups d'État successifs de 2020 et 2021 s'est rapprochée progressivement de Moscou, et est soupçonnée de travailler avec le groupe paramilitaire russe Wagner, ce que Bamako dément. Cela a érodé les liens avec les partenaires occidentaux. La France a achevé à l'été le retrait de ses troupes qui opéraient au Mali depuis près de dix ans pour tenter de faire rempart à la propagation de la violence jihadiste.

Les Casques bleus sont présents dans le pays depuis 2013 mais les relations de la mission onusienne avec les autorités maliennes se sont dégradées, conduisant à l'annonce du retrait des contingents égyptien, ivoirien et britannique.

Le ministre de la Défense britannique James Heappey a déclaré lundi qu'il se joindrait à la réunion d'Accra, alors que le Royaume-Uni, la France et d'autres pays examinent les possibilités de ""rééquilibrer"" leur déploiement au Sahel et dans les pays côtiers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/francophonie/comments/yylgk3/bénin_burkina_faso_côte_divoire_togo_mali_niger/,,BÉNIN - BURKINA FASO,0

&amp;#x200B;

 **La France suspend son aide au développement avec le Mali. La décision, qui date déjà de quelques semaines, a été rendue publique ce jeudi. Le Quai D'Orsay met en avant le recours de la junte malienne au groupe militaire russe Wagner, ce que Bamako dément.** 

[ Une vue de Bamako capitale du Mali, sur les rives du fleuve Niger. ](https://preview.redd.it/6q88via5vo0a1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=729e97c6d2d8bc366f9814a355ff711cf74a5fc0)

 Le Quai ajoute que Paris maintient néanmoins son « *aide humanitaire* » et quelques soutiens à « *des organisations de la société civile malienne* », sans préciser lesquelles. Cette décision crée l'émoi au sein des ONG. En 2020, La France a fourni 130 millions d'euros d'aide au développement au Mali. Dans une lettre adressée au président de la République, elles dénoncent les conséquences de cette suspension sur les populations vulnérables.

Louis-Nicolas Jandeaux, chargé de plaidoyer au sein d'Oxfam France, dénonce une décision motivée par les tensions entre la France et le Mali. « *Toute cette aide au développement est complètement sacrifiée par un échec diplomatique dans la région du Sahel. Il y a une conséquence réelle qui est celle de l'existence même des organisations de la société civile malienne qui vont perdre quasiment tout leur financement. C'est pourtant encore une fois ces dernières qui veillent à l’amélioration de l'égalité femmes hommes dans le pays, qui milite pour la défense de la démocratie.* »

Louis-Nicolas Jandeaux souligne le paradoxe entre le changement stratégique annoncé de la France dans la région et cette décision : « *C'est totalement paradoxal avec le tournant stratégique souhaité par la France dans la région qui voulait réorienter sa politique vers plus d'actions de développement, de responsabilisation des acteurs sahéliens. C'est vraiment une décision qui va à contre-courant de tout ça.* »

## « On est dans un processus qui démarre »

Pour Bruno Fuchs, député français de la commission des Affaires étrangères, il est trop tôt pour crier haro : « *D'abord, les choses ne sont pas complètement calées. On est dans un processus qui démarre, qui est de dire que politiquement, la France ne peut plus travailler avec l'État malien. Et ensuite, je pense, cas par cas, il faut voir avec quelles associations et dans quelles situations on pourra continuer de travailler au Mali. Il faudra voir également les questions de sécurité, la faisabilité, la capacité à* *assurer l'aide au développement, mais la France doit rester avec les populations maliennes.* »

« *On ne peut pas laisser aujourd'hui Wagner et le gouvernement malien face aux groupes armés jihadistes qui, eux, revendiquent de protéger la population*, insiste le député français. *Donc l'aide d'urgence, ça, c'est sûr, elle va continuer du côté français. Et pour le reste, je pense qu’il va y avoir des discussions à partir des prochains jours pour voir le périmètre de l'aide que la France va continuer à accorder* *?* »

 La junte [malienne](https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/mali) a annoncé lundi soir interdire les activités de toutes les organisations non-gouvernementales financées ou soutenues par la France, y compris celles opérant dans le domaine [humanitaire](https://www.20minutes.fr/monde/aide_humanitaire/).

## Le groupe Wagner au cœur des tensions

Le ministère français des Affaires étrangères avait invoqué comme raison le recours au groupe paramilitaire russe Wagner de la part des autorités maliennes.

Le colonel Maïga dénonce dans son communiqué des « allégations fantaisistes » et un « subterfuge destiné à tromper et manipuler l’opinion publique nationale et internationale aux fins de déstabilisation et d’isolement du Mali ». « En conséquence, le gouvernement de la transition décide d’interdire, avec effet immédiat, toutes les activités menées par les ONG opérant au Mali sur financement ou avec l’appui matériel ou technique de la France, y compris dans le domaine humanitaire », dit-il.

CONTEXT:

Putin had been having some very bad days in September.

Despite a rally in early summer that looked like the tide of the war was finally turning from ""kind of a standstill"" to ""hey the Russians are doing well today"", at the beginning of August there was a push to take back the city of Kherson and through wartime nonsense that I don't begin to understand, the Ukrainian counterintelligence was able to essentially trick the Russians into leaving the north of Ukraine vulnerable. They moved in and thoroughly SPANKED them, in a move that saw the Russians retreating and leaving a large swathe of territory back in Ukrainian hands. Morale among his troops had never been lower, so in September they made the baffling decision to start up the conscription process to throw more bodies at the war machine. Convicts, students, basically anyone not nailed down was now required to serve their country. As you can imagine, desertion and surrender has never been higher in the Russian army as these forced soldiers lose all will to keep fighting for a bloodthirsty oligarch who doesn't give a FUCK about them.

Enter today's video, an unmistakable warning to other deserters of what will happen to them if they dare leave the service of their glorious leader: a sledgehammer to the fucking temple.

""Do not forget, there are not only traitors who throw away their automatic guns and go over to the enemy. Some traitors are holed up in offices, not thinking about their own people. Some of them use their own business jets to fly to those countries that seem neutral to us so far. They fly away so as not to participate in today’s problems. They are traitors too.""

\-Yvgeny Prigozhin, Russian oligarch and head of the Wagner company, in a video recruiting convicts 

Yevgeny Nuzhin was supposed to be released next year.

Born in 1967, there isn't much about the first 30 years of his life. He served in the Russian military as a young man, and we can assume that he was patriotic based off of his social media posts while in prison. In 1999, he was convicted of murder in what I THINK was a botched robbery? the translation is a little spotty, but to hear him tell it, it got ""messy"" and he was forced to shoot and kill someone. Due to Russian changing the max sentence he could get for it, he ended up with 28 years in prison instead of 15. 

And that's exactly where this man's been for the last 24 years, bouncing from one penal colony to another, until late August of this year when vital Putin ally and head of the infamously brutal mercenary group the Wagner company Yevgeny Prigozhin shows up to recruit them.

""Ukrainian Interviewer: Do I understand correctly, Prigozhin arrived by helicopter?

Nuzhin: Yes.

Interviewer: And directly himself?

Nuzhin: Alone, alone.

\-Interviewer: Did he campaign for you to participate in the war?

Nuzhin: Absolutely, that's right.

Interviewer: What? What arguments did he give? Why should you do it?

Nuzhin: He promised everyone a pardon. Now the salary there is 100 thousand. If they kill you, 5 million, whatever, family. ""

\-Nuzhin's interview with Ukrainian media

Nuzhin was shipped over with his other conscripts on August 25th. 

According to Nuzhin in that interview he gave, he had only agreed to join in to get out of prison. The plan had always been to defect to the Ukrainians, and two days after landing in the Luhansk region, he dipped out of there. Apparently by this point, news had more than spread about how hopeless and pointless Russia's war was, and in Nuzhin's eyes, him and his fellow conscripts were little more than cannon fodder, warm bodies to throw at Ukraine who wouldn't matter when they died. This was too much for the man, and apparently too much for some of his group because he wasn't the only one to surrender on September 4th. What broke him was an operation the day before where he was tasked with retrieving dead Russian soldiers, but got caught in heavy shelling and suffered numerous casualties. He made his way to the Ukrainian forces and surrendered, and while he was detained for questioning, he proclaims to have been treated better than he ever was by the Russians.

""Interviewer: At what point did you decide that you would surrender and why?

Nuzhin: It's also when I was in the camp, it all started, I was watching TV, I didn't even have a phone there. And then I looked, here is the Russian Legion, they were calling for people to come. And then, when this mess started, damn it, I already decided for myself that when I arrived, I would give up and try to get there. I will tell you this. I got caught here, what was shown on TV, from Ukraine and so on, and propaganda on the Internet, recently, YouTube began to block them, more Ukrainian came out, if you want to know the truth, it is better to go to Ukrainian and listen. Because there was more truth there. And when I got here, I did not see what they say on television, on ours. I saw normal people. Sitting here, I was almost half-naked - they found me, gave me shoes so I wouldn't get cold, and so on. And the attitude is a normal human attitude.""

That's where this interview comes from. 

Several interviews with Russian defectors have been released over the course of the conflict, and they all paint a seriously depressing picture of what it's actually like to be fighting for the most hated military on the planet at the moment. Pure incompetence abounds, as well as the oppressive thumb of Putin breathing down everyone's necks to stay in line. Nuzhin talks about how you couldn't discuss anything with fellow captives for fear of being ratted out, whole platoons being ""zeroed out"", aka killed, for daring to question your commanders, how most of the convicts are drug addicts for some reason, and most heartbreakingly of all, his refusal to fight the Ukrainians when he HAS Ukrainian family. He speaks frankly about the use of propaganda in Russia to dehumanize the Ukrainians and how the suppression of information is leading directly to the deaths of his fellow soldiers, thrown at the bullets out of desperation. 

This interview was conducted the middle of September. Allegedly, Nuzhin had agreed to be exchanged back to Russia as part of a prisoner exchange program, possibly as a way to see his family again. But whether he was released into their waiting clutches or he was taken, on November 11th, Yevgeny Nuzhin would be abducted off the streets of Kyiv by the Wagner group.  Hours later, a video would be released on the Russian Telegraph channels titled ""Hammer of Revenge"".

In the video, we see Yevgeny Nuzhin, head taped to what looks like a stack of bricks, as people in camo mill around in the background. He looks tired, possibly aware of what his fate is going to be, as his hands don't appear to be tied in any way. It must've been so pointless to fight back that he didn't bother trying. He looks at the camera and, as is common for these videos, states the following:

""I'm Nuzhin Yevgeny Anatolivich. 1967 birth year. I went to the front to switch sides to Ukraine and fight against Russians. 4th of September, I completed my plan of switching to the Ukrainian side. 11th of November, 22nd year, I was on the streets of Kyiv where I got hit on the head, resulting in me losing consciousness. I regained consciousness in this basement. Where I was informed, they're going to judge me.""

It's then that the hammer swings out and smashes him in the side of the face and neck, crumpling him instantly. The assailant then goes in and smacks him one more time for good measure, as the word ""LIQUIDATED"" comes on the screen. It's not shocking or brutal like a lot of the gore videos we cover on here, but it IS really sad. He wanted to get away from the killing, and got killed instead.

According to his family, he had been alive and well inside Ukrainian custody as early as the first of the month. What the hell happened? Was he willingly given to the Wagner company? was there a covert infiltration to get him? His sons blame the Ukrainian army for just handing him over, but I can't find anything that says either way what happened. But this video, and knowing that he had been public and vocal about his disdain for the Russian army, sure paints it that way. But yet another source says that he DIDN'T want to be part of any exchange and was kidnapped. It's still too early to know how and why this man ended up killed, which is almost as frustrating as knowing that there won't be any justice for him or any other defectors murdered like this until well after the conflict's over.

The video riled up anger towards the Russians AND the Ukrainians alike. Some people have put the blame for the death on the practice of interviewing the defectors to begin with, as not only does it paint a giant target on their backs, but the backs of everyone who knows them, all in the name of support for Ukraine. President Zelenskyy is actually going to investigate this killing, and whether or not a clerical error on their part led to it. But honestly, the more likely culprit is the easiest: The Russians are killing anyone who dares to question their place in this war, and Yevgeny Nuzhin just happened to be the next in line for it. After all, it's not a great look when the man who recruited Nuzhin in the first place praises the video.

“Regarding the sledgehammered man, this show shows that he did not find happiness in Ukraine, but was met by unkind yet just people. I think this film is called ‘A dog gets a dog’s death.’ Great directors’ work, you can watch it in one go. I hope no animals were hurt during the filming.”
